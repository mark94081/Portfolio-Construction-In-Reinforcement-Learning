  abstract             = {Conventional risk measures may not accurately describe the volatility investors actually experience, especially for portfolios servicing their retirement spending needs. Return volatility rises as its calculated holding period nears 1 year and falls as it lengthens to 10 years. Lower volatility at longer holding periods implies that longer-term mean reversion exists. A portfolio achieves the greatest extra-return benefit by rebalancing over the holding period of highest volatility. Time diversification is helpful, up until long-term uncertainty about the value of reinvested cash flows from dividends leads to rising volatility.},

We apply these measures to a set of daily arithmetically-compounded returns, in U.S. dollar terms, on a set of ten market indices representing the major European markets for a nine-year period from the beginning of 2005 to the end of 2013. The sample period, which incorporates the periods of both the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the subsequent European Debt Crisis (EDC), is a challenging one for the application of portfolio investment strategies. The analysis is undertaken via the examination of multiple investment strategies and a variety of hold-out periods and backtests. We commence by using four two-year estimation periods and a subsequent one-year investment hold out period, to analyse a naive 1/N diversification strategy and to contrast its effectiveness with Markowitz mean variance analysis with positive weights. Markowitz optimisation is then compared to various down-side investment optimisation strategies. We begin by comparing Markowitz with CVaR, and then proceed to evaluate the relative effectiveness of Markowitz with various draw-down strategies, utilising a series of backtests. Our results suggest that none of the more sophisticated optimisation strategies appear to dominate naive diversification.},

Thus we are left with an unsatisfying debate conducted in a paradigm where terminal wealth is usually a function only of returns, and where time-weighted measures are assumed to adequately evaluate performance. This paper reviews the major streams in the time diversification literature and argues that more realistic analysis using defensible assumptions is likely to lead to better prescriptions for improved retirement investing},

  abstract    = {This paper analyses various measures of portfolio diversification, and explores the implication in terms of advanced risk reporting techniques. We use the minimal linear torsion approach (Meucci et al. (2013)) to turn correlated constituents into uncorrelated factors, and focus on the effective number of (uncorrelated) bets (ENB), the entropy of the distribution of risk factor contribution to portfolio risk, as a meaningful measure of the degree of diversification in a portfolio.

In an attempt to assess whether a relationship exists between the degree of diversification of a portfolio and its performance in various market conditions, we empirically analyse the diversification of various equity indices and pension fund policy portfolios. We find strong evidence of a significantly positive time-series and cross-sectional relationship between the ENB risk diversification measure and performance in bear markets.

This relationship, however, is highly linear, and the top performing portfolios in severe bear markets are typically portfolios concentrated in safe assets, as opposed to well-diversified portfolios. We also find statistical and economic evidence that this diversification measure has predictive power for equity market returns, a predictive power which becomes substantial over long holding period.

Overall our results suggest that the ENB measure could be a useful addition to the list of risk indicators reported for equity and policy portfolios.},

The risk measure commonly used to select ERC portfolios is volatility. We propose here new developments of the ERC approach using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a risk measure. Furthermore, under appropriate conditions, we also provide an approach to find a CVaR ERC portfolio as a solution of a convex optimization problem. We investigate how these classes of portfolio models (Minimum-Risk, Capital-Diversification, and Risk-Diversification) work on seven investment universes, each with different sources of risk, including equities, bonds, and mixed assets. Then, we highlight some strengths and weaknesses of all portfolio strategies in terms of various performance measures.},

Moreover, we uncover three additional findings related to dependence. First, the timing of downside risk differs depending on the region. Surprisingly, recent Latin American returns exhibit little downside risk. Second, Latin America exhibits a great deal of correlation complexity. Third, according to the empirical results, correlation does not vary with returns, but extreme dependence does vary monotonically with regional returns.

Our results are consistent with a tradeoff between international diversification and systemic risk. They also suggest international limits to diversification, and that international investors demand some compensation for joint downside risk during extreme events.},

Initially, Sharpe (1964) Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) postulated that security markets can be described by a single factor (market beta). The basic premise of the model is that market participants require a risk premium for investing in high-beta assets that are typically considered more risky than low-beta assets. However, in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, two major trends emerged in the investment industry that laid the groundwork for the rise of factor-based investment strategies: 1) Investors started to evaluate and implement portfolio diversification in terms of underlying systematic risk factors given the failure of active management to provide adequate downside protection. 2) Investors demanded cost-effective, transparent and systematic alternative investment vehicles that could capture most or at least parts of active managers excess return. As a consequence, factor-based investing has grown in popularity and rapidly attracted academics, asset managers and institutional investors.},

DRP strives for maximum diversification along uncorrelated risk sources. A straightforward way to derive uncorrelated risk sources relies on principal components analysis (PCA). While the ensuing statistical factors can be associated with commodity sector bets, the corresponding DRP strategy entails excessive turnover because of the instability of the PCA factors. We suggest an alternative design of the DRP strategy relative to common commodity risk factors that implicitly allows for a uniform exposure to commodity risk premia.},

Specifically, country factor portfolios reflect both common variation, which we define as the global factor, and local variation. On average, a US investor could enjoy a 30 percent reduction in portfolio volatility by investing globally. We also document three other properties of equity factors. Like major asset classes, greater market integration is associated with greater factor co-movement, and factor portfolios of different countries tend to be more correlated during bear stock markets. However, unlike asset classes, the correlations of factor portfolios across countries have not been increasing over the last two decades, making global equity factors a particularly desirable addition to a portfolio.},

Providing an updated review of these models since DeMiguel et al. (2009b), I test sixteen strategies across six empirical datasets to see if indeed progress has been made. However, I find that none of the recently suggested strategies consistently outperforms the 1/N or minimum-variance approach in terms of Sharpe ratio, certainty-equivalent return or turnover. This suggests that simple diversification rules are not in fact inefficient, and gains promised by optimal portfolio choice remain unattainable out-of-sample due to large estimation errors in expected returns. Therefore, further research effort should be devoted to both improving estimation of expected returns, and possibly exploring diversification rules that do not require the estimation of expected returns directly, but also use other available information about the stock characteristics.},

This is demonstrated by the large flows into the numerous low-beta and low-volatility strategies that were established in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis. The authors examine the beta anomaly in the academic literature and provide an empirical analysis for stocks in the U.S., developed, and emerging markets. Their primary finding is that beta is not a strong predictor of expected returns, but it is useful when used to help reduce risk in a portfolio. The authors present results for an investment strategy that filters out the highest-beta stocks while controlling for concentration risks by country and sector. The study finds mixed results for beta as an anomaly: Low beta outperforms for international markets, underperforms in emerging markets, and is flat in the U.S. markets. None of these differences appears to be statistically significant. The authors find beta is very useful, however, as a tool for controlling risk, especially in the context of strategies that diversify across countries and sectors.},

This seems to require that in a given working universe, or market, the investment should be spread among all (or almost all) the available assets. Indeed, this is what some classical investment strategies, like Equally-Weighted portfolios, or more recent and refined ones, like Risk Parity, actually recommend.

The purpose of this work consists in giving some empirical evidence of the fact that diversifying through the use of larger portfolios is not the best way to achieve an improvement in out-of-sample performance. More precisely, we investigate the role of the restriction on the number of assets in a portfolio (a cardinality constraint) on the in-sample and out-of-sample outcomes of the Equally-Weighted approach and of some well-known portfolio selection models that minimize risk through the use of Variance, Semi-Mean Absolute Deviation, and Conditional Value-at-Risk.

The algebraic forms for optimal asset weights derived in this article yield generalizable properties of risk-based portfolios, in contrast to empirical simulations that employ a specific set of historical returns, proprietary risk models, and multiple constraints.

Often attributed to a preference for familiarity, this 'correlation puzzle' further reduces effective diversification. We use a multi-country general equilibrium model of portfolio choice to study how bilateral equity holdings are affected by return correlations among alternative destination and source countries. From the theoretical model, we develop an empirical approach to estimate a gravity equation for equity holdings that incorporates the overall covariance structure in a theoretically rigorous yet tractable manner. Estimation using this approach resolves the correlation puzzle, and finds that international investors do seek the diversification benefits of low cross-country correlations, as theory would predict.},

We also find that the returns are relatively uncorrelated to the VRPs of other asset classes and to the traditional equity factors represented by pure factor portfolios (PFPs).

Namely, we extend Rudin and Morgan's (2006) work to numerically solve for the 'Maximum Diversification Index' by means of a genetic algorithm.

Using stock returns data from the S and P-500 index, we show that the MDI can be efficiently implemented to delimit a large set of investable assets by eliminating those subjects that do not improve the diversification characteristics of the underlying portfolio pool. Indeed, a subset of the S and P-500 stocks obtained using the MDI procedure preserves the mean-variance properties of the initial dataset as shown by the ex-post efficient frontiers.},

The recent development of risk-based portfolio construction methods, which emphasise diversification separately from volatility reduction, challenges this equivalence. Using a point-in-time database of liquid equities listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange between 1998 and 2016, a numerical simulation technique is employed to study the behaviour of a range of diversification measures as a portfolio-level attribute and assess and compare their usefulness in estimating out-of-sample portfolio volatility. The empirical performance of maximum diversification portfolios based on each measure is then investigated. It is found that a portfolio?s diversification level is a significant predictor of future portfolio risk beyond that of historic volatility, and that the empirical performance of maximum diversification portfolios, attractive in all cases, depends critically on the definition of diversification applied.},

  abstract     = {Recent history has provided an excellent laboratory to test the robustness of investment processes. Despite claims of diversification, most balanced portfolios and pension funds were concentrated on equity risk and, consequently, key investment decisions ultimately consisted in a single binary bet: buy or sell equity. This led to pro-cyclical returns and generated a broad debate on the effectiveness of active management in generating performance in difficult market conditions.

In 2011 AMUNDI Italy decided to revise the asset allocation process starting with a reinterpretation of portfolio diversification in terms of Diversification Across Macroeconomic Scenarios (DAMS). The main ambitions of DAMS are: (i) to explain complex patterns of large investment universes in terms of a limited number of factors and (ii) to catch up the market risk premium without being exposed to specific macroeconomic dynamics and asset idiosyncratic risk. In a previous study we illustrated the DAMS principle and implications in terms of asset segmentation.

The aim of this paper is to move towards a new framework for multi-asset portfolio management, what we call DAMS second generation. DAMS first generation is enriched with new concepts and tools that enable us (i) to infer market expectations on relevant macroeconomic factors (growth and inflation) and global risk premium, and (ii) to properly manage portfolios via strategic and tactical asset allocation.},

  abstract             = {It's often said that diversification is the only 'free lunch' available to investors; meaning that a properly diversified portfolio reduces total risk without necessarily sacrificing expected return. However, achieving true diversification is easier said than done, especially when we don't fully know what we mean when we're talking about diversification. While the qualitative purpose of diversification is well-known, a satisfactory quantitative definition of portfolio diversification is not. In this report, we summarise a wide range of diversification measures, focussing our efforts on those most commonly used in practice. We categorise each measure based on which portfolio aspect it focusses on: cardinality, weights, returns, risk or higher moments. We then apply these measures to a range of South African equity indices, thus giving a diagnostic review of historical local equity diversification and, perhaps more importantly, providing a description of the investable opportunity set available to fund managers in this space. Finally, we introduce the idea of diversification profiles. These regime-dependent profiles give a much richer description of portfolio diversification than their single-value counterparts and also allow one to manage diversification proactively based on one's view of future market conditions.},

In this article, the authors highlight some drawbacks of the DD measure and go on to propose an alternative measure based on exponential entropy that overcomes the identified shortcomings. The authors present the properties of this new measure and propose it as an alternative for portfolio optimization that incorporates higher moments of asset returns, such as skewness and excess kurtosis.},

In this research, authors aim to develop TEDAS, by introducing three TEDAS modifications differing in allocation weights' determination: a Cornish-Fisher Value-at-Risk minimization, Markowitz diversification rule or naive equal weighting.

The main focus is on the introduction of diversification functions which make diversification quantifiable and which are used as third objective in the optimization. Thus, the resulting efficient frontier extends to a three dimensional surface which includes the original efficient frontier according to Markowitz. Starting with the original Markowitz model through improvements in stochastic modelling in terms of risk measures, copulas, fat tails, etc., leaving the pure return/risk context can be interpreted as a third model generation.},

Emphasis is placed on risk management, given our perspective (shared by many other practitioners), that retaining above average portfolio performance in current market environment depends strongly on having an effective risk management process.

We rely on a comprehensive survey of the literature to describe stylized facts of market returns and main categories of asset allocation methodologies, including Modern Portfolio Theory, Black-Litterman model, factor-based and risk-based strategies. Furthermore, we present both criticisms and defenses of strategies, together with potential issues identified by practitioners and corresponding solutions (if they do exist).

We outline recent enhancements to various types of portfolio strategies, and analyze how to incorporate (in the asset allocation framework) constraints, regularization, personal views, stylized features of empirical market data, and forward information given by financial options market data.

More prominence is given to strategies (risk parity, risk factors, factor investing, smart beta, dynamic, etc.) that were shown to deliver better portfolio performance in terms of returns, diversification, risk, etc. We also discuss a wide ranging collection of performance measures proposed in the literature for quantifying portfolio return, risk and diversification, identify which such measures are most popular with practitioners, and which corresponding strategies have best results (as shown in the literature).

Since a major topic of this study is managing risks, we provide details on the types of risk that portfolios may be exposed to, on approaches and strategies to handle such exposures, with highlighting of tail risk management. Portfolio insurance is also discussed.

We also describe practical aspects needed for a successful portfolio management, including robust estimation of covariances, correlations and model parameters, numerical optimization methods, key questions and issues identified by practitioners, Monte Carlo simulation, comprehensive testing framework, stress testing, available software implementations (usually in R), etc.

To summarize, the study analyzes all ingredients that are required, in our opinion, to deliver portfolios with above average performances and resilient to most risks, and concentrates on the strategies which have emerged as frontrunners in the last few years, both in the literature and in the market.},

We utilize a rolling-sample approach and compare the out-of-sample performance and tail risk of various optimal strategies to that of the naive diversification strategy. Using portfolios consisting of individual stocks, we show that for portfolios containing relatively small number of stocks, naive diversification outperforms optimal mean-variance diversification and is less exposed to tail risk. However, for relatively large number of stocks in the portfolio, naive diversification maintains its superior performance but increases tail risk and results in more concave portfolio returns. These results imply that the outperformance of naive diversification acts as compensation for the increase in tail risk and concavity.},

  abstract     = {Asset-class correlations generally tend to rise during crises. That certainly was true in the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and since then correlations have generally remained elevated as markets switch between binary risk-on/risk-off environments. However, we believe it would be wrong to interpret these developments as conclusive evidence of the death of diversification.

First, academics (Asness, Israelov and Liew [2011]) have stressed that while diversification often fails in short-term panics - especially one as systemic as the 2007-2009 crisis - it does effectively reduce downside risks over longer horizons. Second, high-quality bonds have fairly consistently provided positive returns during stressful market environments. Third, in this article, we argue and show that factor diversification has been more effective than asset-class diversification in general and, in particular, during crises. The last two arguments challenge the concentration in equity risk found in most institutional portfolios, which is also a central argument in favor of more risk-balanced, so-called risk parity, portfolios.

Traditional asset-class diversification involves allocating nominal dollars to various asset classes and their subsets. Several large institutions have begun to explore an alternative perspective of factor allocation, asking: What are the most important factors driving our portfolio returns? This perspective involves at least two changes. First, focus is shifted from dollar allocations to risk allocations. This change often reveals the dominant role of the most volatile asset classes and the portfolio's dependence on equity market direction. Second, portfolio analysis is extended beyond asset classes to dynamic strategy styles or to underlying risk factors. Fundamental factors such as growth, inflation and liquidity are naturally interesting, but they are inherently hard to measure. Most investors prefer investable factors and therefore use market-based proxies - equities for growth, Treasuries for deflation and commodities for inflation.},

The study took a descriptive research design approach on weekly performance of a sample of 7 balanced mutual funds for the year 2013.The study used secondary data sources available at the Capital Market Authority offices and from each mutual funds. The portfolio return was determined by computing the changes in prices of the balanced fund as traded at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) while diversification was determined from the level of Unsystematic Risk in the Performance. The study used the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) multiple linear regression equation. Control variables of the size and age of the fund were introduced in the regression model. The results indicated the existence of a positive relationship between the Unsystematic Risk and Performance of balanced mutual funds with a beta coefficient of 0.069 (t=4.971, p 0.5.

The authors find that the emerging-market ETF portfolio has very low correlations with IVV during the period of the study. Emerging-market ETF portfolios delivered better absolute performance (returns and wealth) but also had much higher risk (standard deviation of returns). However, the risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe and Omega ratios) of IVV was better than that of the emerging-market ETF portfolio. They also look at the effect of adding some emerging-market ETFs to IVV during the period of study. The authors find that adding some emerging-market ETFs to IVV leads to higher absolute returns, better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe and Omega ratios), higher cumulative returns, and increased wealth for U.S. investors. Results are statistically significant at 1\% in all cases. Therefore, U.S. investors should add some emerging-market ETFs to their domestic allocation based on their risk tolerance for better performance (absolute and risk-adjusted).},

The variation was more pronounced during market declines, but differed in extent across economic expansions and contractions. Finally, shocks from one asset class to another were not persistent, meaning that the assets were able to absorb the shocks and quickly return to normalcy.

The implications for portfolio decisions are clear: Even well-diversified portfolios must be updated to reflect changing economic and financial environments, and past asset behavior does not imply similar future behavior.},

Instead of looking for nominal diversification, investors may prefer a diversification of the risk factors that drive portfolio returns. In recent papers, risk factors have been modelled by principal components following Partovi and Caputo (2004). Meucci et al. (2013) show that principal components may not be the best way to model risk factors and propose minimum torsion bets instead.

Although PCs are useful for dimensionality reduction, they are arbitrary because any rotation of the PC basis yields an equally uncorrelated basis. This is problematic because we theoretically demonstrate that any portfolio is the factor-risk-parity portfolio corresponding to a specific uncorrelated basis. To overcome this problem, we rely on the factor-risk-parity portfolio based on the independent components (ICs), which are the rotation of the PCs that are maximally independent, and thus, account for higher-order moments. We propose a shrinkage portfolio that is obtained by combining the minimum-variance portfolio and the IC-risk-parity portfolio. We also show how to exploit the near independence of the ICs to parsimoniously estimate the factor-risk-parity portfolio with respect to Value-at-Risk. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that shrinkage portfolios based on the IC basis outperform those based on the PC basis, as well as the minimum-variance portfolio.},

  abstract             = {In this dissertation, we study a series of diversification strategies in order to improve the understanding of the diversification of investments that was mathematically established by Harry Markowitz. Even though Modern Portfolio Theory considers a trade-off between generating high returns and lowering risks, investment processes inspired by the concept of diversification are generally only addressed with their diversification benefits. Therefore, we analyze the diversification strategies by using portfolio optimization techniques that primarily originated from the mean-variance framework, which considers returns as well as risks with equal importance, in order to more fully understand the quantifiable consequences of various diversification strategies. First, we investigate passive investing and performance benchmarking through analyzing the two most popular equity benchmark portfolios: the cap-weighted portfolio, and the equally-weighted portfolio. As conventional portfolio performance evaluations occur relative to benchmarks, the performance evaluation of the benchmark itself has never been a trivial issue. Thus, an alternative methodology for portfolio performance evaluation that can be conducted without peer information is proposed, and we find little or no evidence of either benchmark portfolio performing better than the average portfolio. In terms of performance benchmarking, however, equally-weighted portfolios exhibit more desirable properties than cap-weighted portfolios. Second, we examine the quantitative properties of asset allocation and asset classification. We derive and compare the closed form expressions for the portfolio performances of asset allocation and direct security selection, and we find that the majority of investors can benefit from employing asset allocation. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the design of asset classes is a critical factor in determining the portfolio performance of employing asset allocation. Hence, we further test the two most widely used within-stock asset classification schemes, i.e. style and industry classifications, and find that the asset designs should not focus on diversification benefits only.

Third, we discuss the viability of robo-advising, which was recently developed during the ongoing expansion of financial technology (FinTech). Robo-advising attempts to lower the entry barrier to financial advising through utilizing automated but personalized algorithms, in order to attract investors with smaller accounts, who are ineligible to receive traditional financial advising services. We investigate the relationship between portfolio size and risk in order to examine the viability of roboadvisers in providing diversification benefits with limited portfolio sizes. The results indicate that a substantial investment is not necessary to gain diversification benefits.},

However, empirical evidence finds no single approach that can achieve a consistently higher risk-adjusted performance than 1/N. In this paper, I propose three averaging rules that synthesize the established approaches in order to mitigate the impact of estimation error on portfolio performance.

The evaluation of the proposed averaging rules on empirical and simulated datasets shows that each rule achieves a consistently higher risk-adjusted performance than 1/N, while all individual portfolio strategies considered in the averaging exercise do not. I find that the observed performance gains are economically and statistically significant. The performance gains are attributable to persistent diversification effects between the portfolio strategies under consideration, as well as to empirical characteristics in portfolio returns that are exploited by one of the averaging rules.},

This finding is due to insufficient data on past returns, which limit investors' ability to accurately estimate the means and covariance structure of securities. The resulting high estimation errors eliminate the benefits of using the means and covariance matrix as compared to the naive strategy in portfolio optimization. Using value-weighted indexes, characteristic-sorted portfolios, or portfolios defined by principal components as underlying assets in mean-variance optimization does not help. At the same time, increasing data frequency or adding data on past earnings may in some cases make mean-variance optimization useful.},

The authors analyze this trade-off in a multi-asset universe with great potential for static diversification.

The empirical results show that regime-based asset allocation is profitable, even when compared to a diversified benchmark portfolio.

The degree to which different entities, (markets, groups of securities, etc.), have different measures of their corresponding distributions tells us the extent to which they are different, aiding participants looking for diversification or looking for more of the same thing. We demonstrate a relationship between covariance and distance measures based on a generic extension of Stein's Lemma.

Numerous simulations applied to different universes have been documented in support of these approaches based on their apparent outperformance versus passive market capitalization-weighted or static fixed-weight portfolios. Many studies attribute the better performance of these risk-based asset allocation approaches to superior diversification.

Given the absence of clearly defined investment objective functions behind these approaches as well as the metrics used by these studies to evaluate ex post performance, Lee puts these approaches into the same context of mean-variance efficiency in an attempt to understand their theoretical underpinnings. In doing so, he hopes to shed some light on what these approaches attempt to achieve and on the characteristics of the investment universe, if indeed these approaches are meant to approximate mean-variance efficiency. Rather than adding to the already large collection of simulation results, Lee uses some simple examples to compare and contrast the portfolio and risk characteristics of these approaches. He also reiterates that any portfolio which deviates from the market capitalization-weighted portfolio is an active portfolio.

He concludes that there is no theory to predict, ex ante, that any of these risk-based approaches should outperform.},

Diversification has a lot to do with the number of stocks in a portfolio. Adding stocks to a portfolio increases the level of diversification, and consequently leads to risk reduction up to a certain number of stocks, beyond which additional stocks are of no benefit, in terms of risk reduction. To explain this phenomenon, this paper investigates the relationship between portfolio diversification and concentration using a genetic algorithm. To quantify diversification, we use the portfolio Diversification Index (PDI). In the case of concentration, we introduce a new quantification method. Concentration is quantified as complexity of the correlation matrix. The proposed method quantifies the level of dependency (or redundancy) between stocks in a portfolio. By contrasting the two methods it is shown that the optimal number of stocks that optimizes diversification depends on both number of stocks and average correlation. Our result shows that, for a given universe, there is a set of Pareto optimal portfolios containing a different number of stocks that simultaneously maximizes diversification and minimizes concentration. The choice portfolio among the Pareto set will depend on the preference of the investor. Our result also suggests that an ideal condition for the optimal number of stocks is when variance reduction benefit of diversification is off-set by the variance contribution of complexity.},

Classical and more modern hierarchical clustering methods are tested, such as Simple Linkage or Directed Bubble Hierarchical Tree for example. A simple and efficient capital allocation within and across clusters of assets at multiple hierarchical levels is computed. The out-of-sample performances of hierarchical clustering based portfolios and more traditional risk-based portfolios are evaluated across three disparate datasets. To avoid data snooping, the comparison of profit measures is assessed using the bootstrap based model confidence set procedure (Hansen et al. (2011)). The empirical results indicate that hierarchical clustering based portfolios are robust, truly diversified and achieve statistically better risk-adjusted performances than commonly used portfolio optimization techniques.},

This paper proposes a new dynamic portfolio strategy based on the time-varying structures of MST networks in Chinese stock markets, where the market condition is further considered when using the optimal portfolios for investment. A portfolio strategy comprises two stages: selecting the portfolios by choosing central and peripheral stocks in the selection horizon using five topological parameters, i.e., degree, betweenness centrality, distance on degree criterion, distance on correlation criterion and distance on distance criterion, then using the portfolios for investment in the investment horizon. The optimal portfolio is chosen by comparing central and peripheral portfolios under different combinations of market conditions in the selection and investment horizons. Market conditions in our paper are identified by the ratios of the number of trading days with rising index or the sum of the amplitudes of the trading days with rising index to the total number of trading days. We find that central portfolios outperform peripheral portfolios when the market is under a drawup condition, or when the market is stable or drawup in the selection horizon and is under a stable condition in the investment horizon. We also find that the peripheral portfolios gain more than central portfolios when the market is stable in the selection horizon and is drawdown in the investment horizon. Empirical tests are carried out based on the optimal portfolio strategy. Among all the possible optimal portfolio strategy based on different parameters to select portfolios and different criteria to identify market conditions, 65dollar; of our optimal portfolio strategies outperform the random strategy for the Shanghai A-Share market and the proportion is 70dollar; for the Shenzhen A-Share market.},

Several investment strategies are created based on PoC and tested on data from major US stock market indices.

Recent research, however, has shown that focusing on risk-factor allocations, rather than asset class allocations, can result in better risk-adjusted portfolio performance. The existing literature has focused on simple allocation strategies such as equal-weighted and equal-risk-weighted portfolios.

In addition to these simple allocation techniques, this paper compares the performance using mean-variance analysis, and presents evidence that the outperformance of risk-factor diversification may not be as conclusive as has been previously presented in the literature.

While confirming some of the prior findings on risk-factor diversification, the research shows that previous findings may be subject to strong caveats. Specifically, the evidence suggests that the selection of risk-factors, portfolio selection techniques and time-period have a large impact on performance outcomes.},

  abstract    = {Diversification is one the main and most important concept in the financial world. It is often said that diversification is the only free lunch in finance. From a qualitative point of view, the concept of diversification is quite clear: a portfolio is well-diversified if shocks in the individual components do not heavily impact on the overall portfolio. Relatively simple to understand then but profoundly difficult to define. Indeed, there is no broadly accepted precise and quantitative definition of diversification.

Over the years, many different measures of diversification have been developed in the literature, each with its pros and cons. In the framework of this thesis, we have chosen to analyze six of them. Because we wanted to confront the weights concentration criterion with the risk minimization criterion, we decided to select measures that are based on the entropy of the weights and others that are based on the sources of risk. Those six different measures are the Shannon's Entropy, the Diversification Delta, the Diversification Ratio, the MarginalRisk Contributions, the Portfolio Diversification Index and the Effective Number of Bets.},

However, adding five alternative assets (real estate, commodities, hedge funds, emerging markets and private equity) to equity and bond portfolios is shown to be harmful for US investors. We use 19 portfolio models, in conjunction with dummy variable regression, to demonstrate this harm over the 1997-2015 period. This finding is robust to different estimation periods, risk aversion levels, and the use of two regimes. Harmful diversification into alternatives is not primarily due to transactions costs or non-normality, but to estimation risk. This is larger for alternative assets, particularly during the credit crisis which accounts for the harmful diversification of real estate, private equity and emerging markets. Diversification into commodities, and to a lesser extent hedge funds, remains harmful even when the credit crisis is excluded.},

The main results of this study are: mean-variance optimised portfolios are highly concentrated and scarcely related to the asset return assumptions; few basis points of expected returns can be converted into a huge amount of extra diversification that making the portfolio allocation more robust to parameter uncertainty; on a more conceptual ground, we investigate the relationship between portfolio risk and diversification concluding that they should be managed distinctly. The empirical analysis presented in this work shows that entropy is a useful means to alleviate the lack of diversification of portfolios on the efficient frontier.},

The authors of this article consider a new approach to managing the active risk profile of a portfolio, an approach that uses active strategies rather than asset allocations as its basic building blocks. The authors show that in this framework, risk reduction is achieved by a combination of two distinct mechanisms asset diversification and signal diversification. Combining alpha strategies based on independent signals can help reduce portfolio risk, even when the returns of the underlying assets are correlated.

One way to achieve signal diversification is by combining strategies with various investment horizons or trading frequencies a technique the authors call horizon diversification. Horizon diversification is an intuitive and robust way to decrease risk in a portfolio of active strategies.},

  abstract    = {Risk parity has recently garnered significant attention, particularly owing to its strong performance to more traditional approaches of asset allocation in the last decade. This paper seeks to shed some light on this framework and outline the main advantages, while highlighting some of the concerns currently at the forefront of the minds of risk parity investors - namely leveraged positions in fixed income assets at this point in the interest rate cycle as well as the increasing correlation among asset classes.

The premise of risk parity as an approach to strategic asset allocation is based on maximal diversification of beta (or risk premia) as it emphasises the balanced contribution of various risk exposures to overall portfolio risk. One should essentially remain agnostic to return forecasts on the basis that volatility is a much more stable estimate than return.

Much has been made recently of the increasing correlation among asset classes and the increasing difficulty of achieving diversification - particularly at times of crisis arising from systemic risk. A number of recent studies have examined the benefits of factor diversification over asset class diversification.

The difference is subtle because when one refers to asset classes one is also referring to compensated risk premia. These themselves are therefore factors. One can think of equities as a growth factor, Treasuries as a deflation factor and commodities as an inflation factor. However, risk premia go much further than these traditional factors, as argued in a previous J.P. Morgan Asset Management white paper on alternative beta [15].

Indeed, when one focuses on the risk premia, there are a much broader and more orthogonal set of factors of which one can take advantage. In addition to those mentioned, for example, we can also include the equity value premium, the size premium, the forward rate bias and the merger arbitrage premium among others as further risk premia.

The literature is clear that factor diversification is generally more appealing to asset class diversification. Ilmanen and Kizer [8] go further and point out that factor diversification has been more effective, particularly during periods of crisis.

In this paper, extending risk parity in this direction can be seen to address the core concerns around traditional risk parity and can offer a very attractive approach to strategic asset allocation.

In order to demonstrate this, data is included from several periods going back to 1927 and shows that 'factor premium' risk parity consistently outperforms and is stronger to 'asset class' risk parity.},

The study further contributes to the literature by showing the importance of a complete view, beyond pure tail parameter considerations. Even in the presence of tail parameters being close to normal, the return risk may still be tremendous, and can only be reduced by diversification effects in property portfolios, and only to a certain time-dependent extent.

A generalization of the risk parity is the risk budgeting when there is a prior for the distribution of the risk contributions.

  abstract             = {This paper conducts a theoretical and empirical investigation of the risks of globally diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds and of optimal intertemporal global portfolio choice for long horizon investors in the presence of permanent cash flow shocks and transitory discount rate shocks to asset values. We show that an upward shift in cross-country one-period return correlations resulting from correlated cash flow shocks increases the risk of global portfolios and reduces investors' willingness to hold risky assets at all horizons. However, a similar upward shift in cross-country one-period return correlations resulting from correlated discount rate shocks has a much more muted effect on long-run portfolio risk and on the willingness to long horizon investors to hold risky assets. Correlated cash flow shocks imply that markets tend to move together at all horizons, thus reducing the scope for global diversification for all investors regardless of their investment horizon. By contrast, correlated discount rate shocks imply that markets tend to move together only transitorily and long-horizon investors can still benefit from global portfolios to diversify long-term cash flow risk. We document a secular increase in the cross-country correlations of stock and government bond returns since the late 1990's. We show that for global equities this increase has been driven primarily by increased cross-country correlations of discount rate shocks, or global capital markets integration, while for bonds it has been driven by both global capital markets integration and increased cross-country correlations of inflation shocks that determine the real cash flows of nominal government bonds. Therefore, despite the significant increase in the short-run correlation of global equity markets, the benefits from global equity portfolio diversification have not declined nearly as much for long-horizon investors as they have for short-horizon investors. By contrast, increased correlation of inflation across markets implies that the benefits of global bond portfolio diversification have declined for long-only bond investors at all horizons. However, it also means that the scope for hedging liabilities using global bonds has increased, benefiting investors with long-dated liabilities. Finally, we show that the well documented negative stock-bond correlation in the U.S. since the late 1990's is a global phenomenon, suggesting that the benefits of stock-bond diversification have increased in all developed markets.},

We find that i) financial transformations imply large information losses, ii) portfolios are more information sensitive than individual stocks only if fundamental analysis is sufficiently informative on the co-movement of assets, that iii) securitisation, in the relevant range of parameters, yields assets that are less information sensitive than the original stocks and that iv) when diversification (or securitisation) is at its best (i.e. when assets are uncorrelated) information losses are maximal. We also address the issue of whether pricing schemes can be introduced to deal with information losses. This is relevant for the transmission of incentives to gather information on the risk origination side. Within a simple mean variance scheme, we find that market incentives are not generally sufficient to make information harvesting sustainable.},

The objective of this article is not to prove or disprove time diversification, but to evaluate whether the concept must be valid for a horizon-based asset allocation framework to be viable and appropriate. Our findings suggest that there is little evidence to support the notion that time moderates the perceived volatility inherent in risky assets. However, we would expect the risk/reward relationships of the past to prevail in the future, and if that is the case, a longer investment horizon may support a willingness and ability to assume the greater uncertainty of equity-centric asset allocations. This may be true particularly for younger investors for whom the allocation to human capital and the risk posed by the erosion of purchasing power by inflation can reasonably be assumed to be greatest.},

Such a graph-theoretic portfolio partitioning technique is shown to allow the investor to devise robust and tractable asset allocation schemes, by virtue of a rigorous graph framework for considering smaller, computationally feasible, and economically meaningful clusters of assets, based on graph cuts. In turn, this makes it possible to fully utilize the asset returns covariance matrix for constructing the portfolio, even without the requirement for its inversion. The advantages of the proposed framework over traditional methods are demonstrated through numerical simulations based on real-world price data.},

The HS-FP framework is a flexible non-parametric estimation approach that considers future asset class behavior to be conditional on time and market environments, and derives a forward looking distribution that is consistent with this view while remaining close as possible to the prior distribution. The framework derives the forward looking distribution by applying unequal time and state conditioned probabilities to historical observations of asset class returns. This is achieved using relative entropy to find estimates with the least distortion to the prior distribution. Here, we use the HS-FP framework on South African financial market data for asset allocation purposes; by estimating expected returns, correlations and volatilities that are better represented through the measured market cycle. We demonstrated a range of state variables that can be useful towards understanding market environments. Concretely, we compare the out-of-sample performance for a specific configuration of the HS-FP model relative to classic Mean Variance Optimization(MVO) and Equally Weighted (EW) benchmark models. The framework displays low probability of backtest overfitting and the out-of-sample net returns and Sharpe ratio point estimates of the HS-FP model outperforms the benchmark models. However, the results are inconsistent when training windows are varied, the Sharpe ratio is seen to be inflated, and the method does not demonstrate statistically significant out-performance on a gross and net basis.},

It is based on a novel concept called portfolio dimensionality that connects diversification to the non-Gaussianity of portfolio returns and can typically be defined in terms of the ratio of risk measures which are homogenous functions of equal degree. The latter arises naturally due to our requirement that diversification measures should be leverage invariant. We introduce this new framework and argue the benefits relative to existing measures of diversification in the literature, before addressing the question of optimizing diversification or, equivalently, dimensionality. Maximising portfolio dimensionality leads to highly non-trivial optimization problems with objective functions which are typically non-convex and potentially have multiple local optima. Two complementary global optimization algorithms are thus presented. For problems of moderate size and more akin to asset allocation problems, a deterministic Branch and Bound algorithm is developed, whereas for problems of larger size a stochastic global optimization algorithm based on Gradient Langevin Dynamics is given. We demonstrate analytically and through numerical experiments that the framework reflects the desired properties often discussed in the literature.},

The Minimum-Torsion Bets allow us to also introduce a natural diversification score, the Effective Number of Minimum-Torsion Bets, which we use to measure and manage diversification.

We discuss the advantages of the Minimum-Torsion Bets over the traditional approach to diversification based on marginal contributions to risk. We present two case studies, a security-based investment in the stocks of the S\&P 500, and a factor-based investment in the five Fama-French factors.},

First, dependence has increased over time.

Second, we find evidence of asymmetric dependence or downside risk in Latin America, but less in the G5. The results indicate very little downside risk in East Asia.

Third, East Asian and Latin American returns exhibit some correlation complexity. Interestingly, the regions with maximal dependence or worst diversification do not command large returns. Our results suggest international limits to diversification. They are also consistent with a possible tradeoff between international diversification and systemic risk.},

Numerous simulations, applied to different universes, have been documented in support of these approaches based on their apparent outperformance versus passive market-capitalization weighting or static, fixed weight portfolios. Many studies attribute the better performance of these risk-based asset allocation approaches to superior diversification.

Given the absence of clearly defined investment objective functions behind these approaches as well as the metrics used by these studies to evaluate ex-post performance, we put these approaches into the same context of mean-variance efficiency in an attempt to understand their theoretical underpinnings. In doing so, we hope to shed some light on what these approaches attempt to achieve and on the characteristics of the investment universe, if indeed these approaches are meant to approximate meanvariance efficiency.

Rather than adding to the already large collection of simulation results, we use some simple examples to compare and contrast the portfolio and risk characteristics of these approaches. We also reiterate that any portfolio that deviates from the market capitalization-weighted portfolio is an active portfolio.

Finally, we conclude there is no theory to predict, ex-ante, that any of these riskbased approaches should outperform.},

However, the optimization approach tends to amplify the estimation errors on the parameters required by the model, such as expected returns and covariances. For this reason, the Risk Parity model, a novel risk diversification approach to portfolio selection, has been recently theoretically developed and used in practice, mainly for the case of the volatility risk measure. Here we first provide new theoretical results for the Risk Parity approach for general risk measures. Then we propose a novel framework for portfolio selection that combines the diversification and the optimization approaches through the global solution of a hard nonlinear mixed integer or pseudo Boolean problem. For the latter problem we propose an efficient and accurate Multi-Greedy heuristic that extends the classical single-threaded greedy approach to a multiple-threaded setting. Finally, we provide empirical results on real-world data showing that the diversified optimal portfolios are only slightly suboptimal in-sample with respect to optimal portfolios, and generally show improved out-of-sample performance with respect to their purely diversified or purely optimized counterparts.},

When most assets did fall together in largely simultaneous fashion in the midst of the recent credit crisis, investors rated diversification a failure, and cried out in frustration that correlations had all converged on one. Diversification failed this year, 1 was the title of a New York Times article in the business section in November last year. In another, more recent article,2 one of the large university endowments explained that diversification had failed to protect its asset values. This sentiment was, and is, entirely common. If their eggs were all in different baskets, then it would appear that they were somehow all tied together sharing a common fate when their fates were assumed to have been independent of one another instead. There are several aspects of this that are wrong.

We consider a number of portfolio construction approaches designed to capture factor premiums with the appropriate levels of risk controls aiming at increasing information ratios. We show that information ratios can be increased by targeting constant volatility (CV) over time, hedging market beta (HB) and hedging exposures to the size factor, i.e. neutralizing biases in the market capitalization of stocks used in factor strategies. With regard to the neutralization of sector exposures, we find this to be of particular importance for the value and low-risk factors. Finally, we look at the added value of shorting stocks in factor strategies. We find that with few exceptions the contributions to performance from the short leg are inferior to those from the long leg. Thus, long-only strategies can be efficient alternatives to capture these factor premiums. Finally, we find that factor premiums tend to have fatter tails than what could be expected from a Gaussian distribution of returns, but that skewness is not significantly negative in most cases.},

Based on parameters calibrated to the US equity market, our analytical results and simulations show that the estimation window needed for the sample-based mean-variance strategy and its extensions to outperform the 1/N benchmark is around 3000 months for a portfolio with 25 assets and about 6000 months for a portfolio with 50 assets.

However, the Australian government encourages investors to consolidate retirement savings into just one fund. Using a number of optimization techniques, we investigate which of these two actions would result in the best outcome for investors in terms of risk and return. We find that in the majority of cases investors would be better off not diversifying their holdings; mainly because superannuation funds cannot be short sold.

  abstract             = {For global equity diversification, prominent Markowitz extensions do not outperform several heuristic weighting schemes (1/N heuristic, market value-weighting and GDP-weighting). Comparing the different heuristic stock weighting schemes, the value-weighted heuristic performs worse than the GDP-weighted global stock portfolio. Diversification gains in the asset allocation context are mainly driven by a well-balanced allocation over different asset classes. Consistent with global equity diversification, Markowitz-based optimization methods do not add significant value when allocating across different asset classes. This paper evaluates numerous diversification strategies as a possible remedy against widespread costly investment mistakes of individual investors. Our results reveal that a very broad range of simple heuristic allocation schemes offers similar diversification gains as well-established or recently developed portfolio optimization approaches. This holds true for both international diversification in the stock market and diversification over different asset classes. We thus suggest easy-to-implement allocation guidelines for individual investors.},

Our results portray the frequency and magnitude of risk-adjusted return improvement coming from different diversifying asset classes over five-year holding periods. We find that certain asset classes, such as below investment grade fixed income, regularly improve risk-adjusted return of the portfolio, while other asset classes like commodities improve risk-adjusted returns less frequently. Further, we observe that some asset classes do not deliver meaningful risk-adjusted return improvements in the presence of other asset classes. Our conclusion is that investors should continue to build diversified portfolios, but in doing so they should consider that some asset classes more consistently improved risk-adjusted returns than others.},

Portfolios are adaptive, meaning they automatically adjust their allocation in response to changing market conditions. The adjustments are model-based and transparent, and align in terms of frequency and magnitude with the investor’s emotionality. The process looks beyond the risk-focused paradigm in relation to investor profiling, product positioning, and portfolio construction. First, investor profiles distinguish between the attitude toward risk and the attitude toward loss. Second, products differentiate in terms of variance and in terms of skewness. Finally, adaptive portfolios represent a client centric combination of products that lifts the power of diversification to a higher level and ultimately contributes to long term buy-and-hold investor behavior.},

Thus, the loading matrix has a single nonzero element in each row and zeros elsewhere. Such a loading matrix is the sparsest possible for certain number of variables and common factors. For this reason, the proposed method is named sparsest FA (SSFA). It may also be called FA-based variable clustering, since the variables loading the same common factor can be classified into a cluster. In SSFA, all model parts of FA (common factors, their correlations, loadings, unique factors, and unique variances) are treated as fixed unknown parameter matrices and their least squares function is minimized through specific data matrix decomposition. A useful feature of the algorithm is that the matrix of common factor scores is re-parameterized using QR decomposition in order to efficiently estimate factor correlations. A simulation study shows that the proposed procedure can exactly identify the true sparsest models. Real data examples demonstrate the usefulness of the variable clustering performed by SSFA.},

With emerging new concepts like cloud computing and big data and their vast applications in recent years, research works have been increased on unsupervised solutions like clustering algorithms to extract knowledge from this avalanche of data. Clustering time-series data has been used in diverse scientific areas to discover patterns which empower data analysts to extract valuable information from complex and massive datasets. In case of huge datasets, using supervised classification solutions is almost impossible, while clustering can solve this problem using un-supervised approaches. In this research work, the focus is on time-series data, which is one of the popular data types in clustering problems and is broadly used from gene expression data in biology to stock market analysis in finance. This review will expose four main components of time-series clustering and is aimed to represent an updated investigation on the trend of improvements in efficiency, quality and complexity of clustering time-series approaches during the last decade and enlighten new paths for future works.},

The number of clusters at which the index attains its maximum is a candidate for the optimal number of clusters. The proposed method is applied to simulated bivariate normal data, and further extended for use in circular data. Its performance is compared to the criteria discussed in Tibshirani, Walther, and Hastie (2001).

The proposed method attempts to capture the level of similarity of each of the time series based on sensitivity to observable factors as well as to the unobservable factor structure. The proposed method allows for correlations between observable and unobservable factors and also allows for cross-sectional and serial dependence and heteroscedasticities in the error structure, which are common in financial markets. In addition, theoretical properties are established for the procedure. We apply the method to analyze the returns for over 6000 international stocks from over 100 financial markets. The empirical analysis quantifies the extent to which the U.S. subprime crisis spilled over to the global financial markets. Furthermore, we find that nominal classifications based on either listed market, industry, country or region are insufficient to characterize the heterogeneity of the global financial markets.

The purpose of this article is to put together the two distinct ideas, namely mixtures and copulas, so as to use mixtures of copulas aiming at using them for clustering with respect to the dependence properties of the data. This is accomplished by considering finite mixture of different copulas to represent different dependence structures. We provide properties of the derived models along with the description of an estimation method using an EM algorithm based on the standard approach for mixture models.

However, as an unsupervised learning method, it requires making choices that are nontrivially influenced by the nature of the data involved. The aim of this paper is to verify usefulness of the time series clustering method for macroeconomics research, and to develop the most suitable methodology. By extensively testing various possibilities, we arrive at a choice of a dissimilarity measure (compression-based dissimilarity measure, or CDM) which is particularly suitable for clustering macroeconomic variables. We check that the results are stable in time and reflect large-scale phenomena such as crises. We also successfully apply our findings to analysis of national economies, specifically to identifying their structural relations.},

Our methodology identifies the primary strategies used by a trader and determines which strategy the trader used for each order in the sample. Having identified the strategy used for each order, trading cost analysis can be performed by strategy. We also discuss ways to exploit this technique to characterize trader behavior, assess trader performance, and suggest the appropriate benchmarks for each distinct trading strategy.},

For example, the literature on neighborhood determinants of health continues to grow. Likewise, community randomized trials are applied to learn about real-world implementation, sustainability, and population effects of interventions with proven individual-level efficacy. In these settings, individual-level outcomes are correlated due to shared cluster-level factors, including the exposure, as well as social or biological interactions between individuals. To flexibly and efficiently estimate the effect of a cluster-level exposure, we present two targeted maximum likelihood estimators (TMLEs). The first TMLE is developed under a non-parametric causal model, which allows for arbitrary interactions between individuals within a cluster. These interactions include direct transmission of the outcome (i.e. contagion) and influence of one individual's covariates on another's outcome (i.e. covariate interference). The second TMLE is developed under a causal sub-model assuming the cluster-level and individual-specific covariates are sufficient to control for confounding. Simulations compare the alternative estimators and illustrate the potential gains from pairing individual-level risk factors and outcomes during estimation, while avoiding unwarranted assumptions. Our results suggest that estimation under the sub-model can result in bias and misleading inference in an observational setting. Incorporating working assumptions during estimation is more robust than assuming they hold in the underlying causal model. We illustrate our approach with an application to HIV prevention and treatment.},

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and in particular Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have proven recently that they are able to outperform state-of-the-art univariate time series forecasting methods in this context when trained across all available time series. However, if the time series database is heterogeneous, accuracy may degenerate, so that on the way towards fully automatic forecasting methods in this space, a notion of similarity between the time series needs to be built into the methods. To this end, we present a prediction model that can be used with different types of RNN models on subgroups of similar time series, which are identified by time series clustering techniques. We assess our proposed methodology using LSTM networks, a widely popular RNN variant. Our method achieves competitive results on benchmarking datasets under competition evaluation procedures. In particular, in terms of mean sMAPE accuracy, it consistently outperforms the baseline LSTM model and outperforms all other methods on the CIF2016 forecasting competition dataset.},

Minimax linkage is unique in naturally associating a prototype chosen from the original dataset with every interior node of the dendrogram. These prototypes can be used to greatly enhance the interpretability of a hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, we prove that minimax linkage has a number of desirable theoretical properties; for example, minimax-linkage dendrograms cannot have inversions (unlike centroid linkage) and is robust against certain perturbations of a dataset. We provide an efficient implementation and illustrate minimax linkage's strengths as a data analysis and visualization tool on a study of words from encyclopedia articles and on a dataset of images of human faces.},

Accuracy cannot be measured for most of the real-world networks since real clustering is unavailable. Thus, it will be advantageous from the viewpoint of expert systems to develop a quality metric that can assure certain level of accuracy along with the quality of clustering. In this paper we have proposed a set of three quality metrics for graph clustering that have the ability to ensure accuracy along with the quality. The effectiveness of the metrics has been evaluated on benchmark graphs as well as on real-world networks and compared with existing metrics. Results indicate competency of the suggested metrics while dealing with accuracy, which will definitely improve the decision-making in expert and intelligent systems.

Results show that price clustering is markedly higher in tech stocks than in nontech stocks during this period of rising, sector-specific, investor sentiment.

Traditional approaches to this problem are based on the idea of partitioning the input data into a predetermined number of classes, thereby obtaining the clusters as a by-product of the partitioning process. A radically different perspective of the problem consists in providing a formalization of the very notion of a cluster and considering the clustering process as a sequential search of structures in the data adhering to this cluster notion. In this manuscript we review one of the pioneering approaches falling in the latter class of algorithms, which has been proposed in the early 2000s and has been found since then a number of applications in different domains. It is known as dominant set clustering and provides a notion of a cluster (a.k.a. dominant set) that has intriguing links to game-theory, graph-theory and optimization theory. From the game-theoretic perspective, clusters are regarded as equilibria of non-cooperative "clustering" games; in the graph-theoretic context, it can be shown that they generalize the notion of maximal clique to edge-weighted graphs; finally, from an optimization point of view, they can be characterized in terms of solutions to a simplex-constrained, quadratic optimization problem, as well as in terms of an exquisitely combinatorial entity. Besides introducing dominant sets from a theoretical perspective, we will also focus on the related algorithmic issues by reviewing two state-of-the-art methods that are used in the literature to find dominant sets clusters, namely the Replicator Dynamics and the Infection and Immunization Dynamics. Finally, we conclude with an overview of different extensions of the dominant set framework and of applications where dominant sets have been successfully employed.},

By using a correlation matrix time series and a participation frequency method based on the random matrix theory, we show that a time-stable information structure is contained in the correlations between global financial markets. We further find that the information structure is closely associated with global market and global geographical factors, and that each financial index's participation in the global market factor varies over time and presents dynamics. Two patterns, hierarchy and cluster effects, are found to be in the dynamics of the indices' participation in the global market factor. The cluster effect implies a more concentrated participation during the 2008 financial crisis.},

The latter enforces imperviousness to change in units of measure whereas the former ensures local consistency of the clustering outcome. Algorithmically, excisiveness implies that we can reduce computational complexity by only clustering a data subset of interest while theoretically guaranteeing that the same hierarchical outcome would be observed when clustering the whole dataset. Moreover, we introduce the concept of representability, i.e. a generative model for describing clustering methods through the specification of their action on a collection of networks. We further show that, within a rich set of admissible methods, requiring representability is equivalent to requiring both excisiveness and linear scale preservation. Leveraging this equivalence, we show that all excisive and linear scale preserving methods can be factored into two steps: a transformation of the weights in the input network followed by the application of a canonical clustering method. Furthermore, their factorization can be used to show stability of excisive and linear scale preserving methods in the sense that a bounded perturbation in the input network entails a bounded perturbation in the clustering output.},

The goal is to study methods that, based on the dissimilarity structure, output hierarchical clusters, i.e., a family of nested partitions indexed by a connectivity parameter. Our construction of hierarchical clustering methods is built around the concept of admissible methods, which are those that abide by the axioms of value - nodes in a network with two nodes are clustered together at the maximum of the two dissimilarities between them - and transformation - when dissimilarities are reduced, the network may become more clustered but not less. Two particular methods, termed reciprocal and nonreciprocal clustering, are shown to provide upper and lower bounds in the space of admissible methods. Furthermore, alternative clustering methodologies and axioms are considered. In particular, modifying the axiom of value such that clustering in two-node networks occurs at the minimum of the two dissimilarities entails the existence of a unique admissible clustering method.},

Grafting methods exchange branches between dendrograms generated by different admissible methods. The convex combination family combines admissible methods through a convex operation in the space of dendrograms, and thirdly, the semi-reciprocal family clusters nodes that are related by strong cyclic influences in the network. An algorithmic framework for the computation of hierarchical clusters generated by reciprocal and nonreciprocal clustering as well as the grafting, convex combination, and semi-reciprocal families is presented via matrix operations in a dioid algebra. Finally, the introduced clustering methods and algorithms are exemplified through their application to a network describing the interrelation between sectors of the United States (U.S.) economy.},

  abstract       = {The problem of complex data analysis is a central topic of modern statistical science and learning systems and is becoming of broader interest with the increasing prevalence of high-dimensional data. The challenge is to develop statistical models and autonomous algorithms that are able to acquire knowledge from raw data for exploratory analysis, which can be achieved through clustering techniques or to make predictions of future data via classification (i.e., discriminant analysis) techniques. Latent data models, including mixture model-based approaches are one of the most popular and successful approaches in both the unsupervised context (i.e., clustering) and the supervised one (i.e, classification or discrimination). Although traditionally tools of multivariate analysis, they are growing in popularity when considered in the framework of functional data analysis (FDA). FDA is the data analysis paradigm in which the individual data units are functions (e.g., curves, surfaces), rather than simple vectors. In many areas of application, the analyzed data are indeed often available in the form of discretized values of functions or curves (e.g., time series, waveforms) and surfaces (e.g., 2d-images, spatio-temporal data). This functional aspect of the data adds additional difficulties compared to the case of a classical multivariate (non-functional) data analysis. We review and present approaches for model-based clustering and classification of functional data. We derive well-established statistical models along with efficient algorithmic tools to address problems regarding the clustering and the classification of these high-dimensional data, including their heterogeneity, missing information, and dynamical hidden structure. The presented models and algorithms are illustrated on real-world functional data analysis problems from several application area.},

Most of the clustering algorithms depend on some assumptions in order to dene the subgroups present in a data set. As a consequence, the resulting clustering scheme requires some sort of evaluation as regards its validity. The evaluation procedure has to tackle dicult problems such as the quality of clusters, the degree with which a clustering scheme ts a specic data set and the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning. In the literature, a wide variety of indices have been proposed to nd the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning of a data set during the clustering process. However, for most of indices proposed in the literature, programs are unavailable to test these indices and compare them. The R package NbClust has been developed for that purpose. It provides 30 indices which determine the number of clusters in a data set and it oers also the best clus- tering scheme from dierent results to the user. In addition, it provides a function to perform k-means and hierarchical clustering with dierent distance measures and aggre- gation methods. Any combination of validation indices and clustering methods can be requested in a single function call. This enables the user to simultaneously evaluate sev- eral clustering schemes while varying the number of clusters, to help determining the most appropriate number of clusters for the data set of interest.},

For many real-world applications, we would like to exploit prior information about the data that imposes constraints on the clustering hierarchy, and is not captured by the set of features available to the algorithm. This gives rise to the problem of hierarchical clustering with structural constraints. Structural constraints pose major challenges for bottom-up approaches like average/single linkage and even though they can be naturally incorporated into top-down divisive algorithms, no formal guarantees exist on the quality of their output. In this paper, we provide provable approximation guarantees for two simple top-down algorithms, using a recently introduced optimization viewpoint of hierarchical clustering with pairwise similarity information (Dasgupta, 2016). We show how to find good solutions even in the presence of conflicting prior information, by formulating a constraint-based regularization of the objective. Furthemore, we explore a variation of this objective for dissimilarity information (Cohen-Addad et al., 2018) and improve upon current techniques. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on a real dataset for the taxonomy application.},

Its goal is to divide (partition) the network into groups (clusters or communities) of "topologically related" nodes, where the resulting topology-based clusters are expected to "correlate" well with node label information, i.e., metadata, such as cellular functions of genes/proteins in biological networks, or age or gender of people in social networks. Even for static data, the problem of network clustering is complex. For dynamic data, the problem is even more complex, due to an additional dimension of the data-their temporal (evolving) nature. Since the problem is computationally intractable, heuristic approaches need to be sought. Existing approaches for dynamic network clustering (DNC) have drawbacks. First, they assume that nodes should be in the same cluster if they are densely interconnected within the network. We hypothesize that in some applications, it might be of interest to cluster nodes that are topologically similar to each other instead of or in addition to requiring the nodes to be densely interconnected. Second, they ignore temporal information in their early steps, and when they do consider this information later on, they do so implicitly. We hypothesize that capturing temporal information earlier in the clustering process and doing so explicitly will improve results. We test these two hypotheses via our new approach called ClueNet. We evaluate ClueNet against six existing DNC methods on both social networks capturing evolving interactions between individuals (such as interactions between students in a high school) and biological networks capturing interactions between biomolecules in the cell at different ages. We find that ClueNet is superior in over 83\% of all evaluation tests. As more real-world dynamic data are becoming available, DNC and thus ClueNet will only continue to gain importance.},

However, none of them consider the effect of covariance among the group of forecasts, even though it could have a dramatic impact on the variance of the group, and therefore on the forecast accuracy. The proposed approach, referred to here as Bagged Cluster ETS, aims to reduce the covariance effect by using partitioning around medoids (PAM) to produce clusters of similar forecasts, then selecting several forecasts from each cluster to create a group with a reduced variance. This approach was tested on various different time series sets from the M3 and CIF 2016 competitions. The empirical results have shown a substantial reduction in the forecast error, considering sMAPE and MASE.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, large amounts of financial data have become available for analysis. We propose exploring returns from 21 European stock markets by model-based clustering of regime switching models. These econometric models identify clusters of time series with similar dynamic patterns and moreover allow relaxing assumptions of existing approaches, such as the assumption of conditional Gaussian returns.

The proposed model handles simultaneously the heterogeneity across stock markets and over time, i.e., time-constant and time-varying discrete latent variables capture unobserved heterogeneity between and within stock markets, respectively. The results show a clear distinction between two groups of stock markets, each one characterized by different regime switching dynamics that correspond to different expected return-risk patterns.

We identify three regimes: the so-called bull and bear regimes, as well as a stable regime with returns close to 0, which turns out to be the most frequently occurring regime. This is consistent with stylized facts in financial econometrics.},

  abstract       = {Abstract The problem of establishing reliable estimates or bounds for the (T)VaR of a joint risk portfolio is a relevant subject in connection with the computation of total economic capital in the Basel regulatory framework for the finance sector as well as with the Solvency regulations for the insurance sector. In the computation of total economic capital, a financial institution faces a considerable amount of model uncertainty related to the estimation of the interdependence amongst the marginal risks. In this paper, we propose to apply a clustering procedure in order to partition a risk portfolio into independent subgroups of positively dependent risks. Based on available data, the portfolio partition so obtained can be statistically validated and allows for a reduction of capital and the corresponding model uncertainty. We illustrate the proposed methodology in a simulation study and two case studies considering an Operational and a Market Risk portfolio. A rule of thumb stems from the various examples proposed: in a mathematical model where the risk portfolio is split into independent subsets with comonotonic dependence within, the smallest VaR-based capital estimate (at the high regulatory probability levels typically used) is produced by assuming that the infinite-mean risks are comonotonic and the finite-mean risks are independent. The largest VaR estimate is instead generated by obtaining the maximum number of independent infinite-mean sums.},

The purpose of this paper is to propose an automatic clustering approach without human intervention. Inspired by the visual selection rule of DPC, the judgment index which equals the lower value within density and distance (after normalization) is proposed for selecting the clustering centers. The judgment index approximately follows the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, and each clustering center judgment index is much higher. Hence, it is reasonable that the points are selected as clustering centers if their judgment indices are larger than the upper quantile of GEV. This proposed method is called density peaks clustering based on generalized extreme value distribution (DPC-GEV). Furthermore, taking the computational complexity into account, an alternative method based on density peak detection using Chebyshev inequality (DPC-CI) is also given. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets show that DPC-GEV and DPC-CI can achieve the same accuracy as DPC on most data sets but consume much less time.},

In clustering we likewise assume that there is some underlying class structure in the data, just that we don know it and have no access to class labels C for our sample X, so that we have to infer it from X alone. This is also called an unsupervised statistical learning problem. In neurobiology this problem frequently occurs, for instance, when we suspect that neural cells in a brain area from their morphological and/or electrophysiological characteristics into different types, when gene sets cluster in functional pathways, when we believe that neural spiking patterns generated spontaneously in a given area are not arranged along a continuum but come from discrete categories (as possibly indicative of an attractor dynamics, see Chap. 9), or when rodents appear to utilize a discrete set of behavioral patterns or response strategies. In many such circumstances, we may feel that similarities between observations (observed feature sets) speak for an underlying mechanism that produces discrete types, but how could we extract such apparent structure and characterize it more formally? In fact, we may not just search for one such specific partition but may aim for a hierarchically nested set of partitions, that is, classes may split into subclasses and so on, as is the case with many natural categories and biological taxonomies. For instance, at a superordinate level, we may group cortical cell types into pyramidal cells and interneurons, which then in turn would split into several subclasses (like fast-spiking, bursting, etc.).},

CLoVA concept can be used as alternative instead of using interval based variable selections for PLS. Analyses of different data sets indicate the superiority of CLoVA respect to available variable selection algorithms. Recently we have proposed a new variable selection algorithm, based on clustering of variable concept (CLoVA) in classification problem. With the same idea, this new concept has been applied to a regression problem and then the obtained results have been compared with conventional variable selection strategies for PLS. The basic idea behind the clustering of variable is that, the instrument channels are clustered into different clusters via clustering algorithms. Then, the spectral data of each cluster are subjected to PLS regression. Different real data sets (Cargill corn, Biscuit dough, ACE QSAR, Soy, and Tablet) have been used to evaluate the influence of the clustering of variables on the prediction performances of PLS. Almost in the all cases, the statistical parameter especially in prediction error shows the superiority of CLoVA-PLS respect to other variable selection strategies. Finally the synergy clustering of variable (sCLoVA-PLS), which is used the combination of cluster, has been proposed as an efficient and modification of CLoVA algorithm. The obtained statistical parameter indicates that variable clustering can split useful part from redundant ones, and then based on informative cluster; stable model can be reached.},

We show that there is a relationship between an exchange rate's functional role within the market and its position within its community and use a node-centric community analysis to track the temporal dynamics of such roles. This reveals which exchange rates dominate the market at particular times and also identifies exchange rates that experienced significant changes in market role. We also use the community dynamics to uncover major structural changes that occurred in the FX market. Our techniques are general and will be similarly useful for investigating correlations in other markets.},

Firstly, we present a method to transform a set of time series into a network using different distance functions, where each time series is represented by a vertex and the most similar ones are connected. Then, we apply community detection algorithms to identify groups of strongly connected vertices (called a community) and, consequently, identify time series clusters. Still in this paper, we make a comprehensive analysis on the influence of various combinations of time series distance functions, network generation methods and community detection techniques on clustering results. Experimental study shows that the proposed network-based approach achieves better results than various classic or up-to-date clustering techniques under consideration. Statistical tests confirm that the proposed method outperforms some classic clustering algorithms, such as k-medoids, diana, median-linkage and centroid-linkage in various data sets. Interestingly, the proposed method can effectively detect shape patterns presented in time series due to the topological structure of the underlying network constructed in the clustering process. At the same time, other techniques fail to identify such patterns. Moreover, the proposed method is robust enough to group time series presenting similar pattern but with time shifts and/or amplitude variations. In summary, the main point of the proposed method is the transformation of time series from time-space domain to topological domain. Therefore, we hope that our approach contributes not only for time series clustering, but also for general time series analysis tasks.},

A first extension deals with the incorporation of generic distance-based penalty minimizers instead of the classical aggregation by means of centroids. Due to that the presented algorithm can be applied in spaces equipped with an arbitrary dissimilarity measure (images, DNA sequences, etc.). Secondly, a correction preventing the formation of clusters of too highly unbalanced sizes is applied: just like in the recently introduced Genie approach, which extends the single linkage scheme, the new method averts a chosen inequity measure (e.g., the Gini-, de Vergottini-, or Bonferroni-index) of cluster sizes from raising above a predefined threshold. Numerous benchmarks indicate that the introduction of such a correction increases the quality of the resulting clusterings significantly.},

  abstract             = {Clustering is a central approach for unsupervised learning. After clustering is applied, the most fundamental analysis is to quantitatively compare clusterings. Such comparisons are crucial for the evaluation of clustering methods as well as other tasks such as consensus clustering. It is often argued that, in order to establish a baseline, clustering similarity should be assessed in the context of a random ensemble of clusterings. The prevailing assumption for the random clustering ensemble is the permutation model in which the number and sizes of clusters are fixed. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in practice; for example, while multiple runs of K-means clustering returns clusterings with a fixed number of clusters, the cluster size distribution varies greatly. Here, we derive corrected variants of two clustering similarity measures (the Rand index and Mutual Information) in the context of two random clustering ensembles in which the number and sizes of clusters vary. In addition, we study the impact of one-sided comparisons in the scenario with a reference clustering. The consequences of different random models are illustrated using synthetic examples, handwriting recognition, and gene expression data. We demonstrate that the choice of random model can have a drastic impact on results and argue that the choice should be carefully justified.},

  abstract       = {Feature subset selection is basically an optimization problem for choosing the most important features from various alternatives in order to facilitate classification or mining problems. Though lots of algorithms have been developed so far, none is considered to be the best for all situations and researchers are still trying to come up with better solutions. In this work, a flexible and user-guided feature subset selection algorithm, named as FCTFS (Feature Cluster Taxonomy based Feature Selection) has been proposed for selecting suitable feature subset from a large feature set. The proposed algorithm falls under the genre of clustering based feature selection techniques in which features are initially clustered according to their intrinsic characteristics following the filter approach. In the second step the most suitable feature is selected from each cluster to form the final subset following a wrapper approach. The two stage hybrid process lowers the computational cost of subset selection, especially for large feature data sets. One of the main novelty of the proposed approach lies in the process of determining optimal number of feature clusters. Unlike currently available methods, which mostly employ a trial and error approach, the proposed method characterises and quantifies the feature clusters according to the quality of the features inside the clusters and defines a taxonomy of the feature clusters. The selection of individual features from a feature cluster can be done judiciously considering both the relevancy and redundancy according to user intention and requirement. The algorithm has been verified by simulation experiments with different bench mark data set containing features ranging from 10 to more than 800 and compared with other currently used feature selection algorithms. The simulation results prove the superiority of our proposal in terms of model performance, flexibility of use in practical problems and extendibility to large feature sets. Though the current proposal is verified in the domain of unsupervised classification, it can be easily used in case of supervised classification.},

This paper builds upon an algorithm introduced in [1] that is successful for finding multiple optima within the input space of the objective function. Here we introduce an alternative cluster search algorithm for finding these optima, making use of clustering. The cluster search algorithm has several advantages over the earlier algorithm. It gives a forward view of the optima that are present in the input space so the user has a preview of what to expect as the optimization process continues. It employs pattern search, in many instances, closer to the minimum's location in input space, saving on simulator point computations. At termination, this algorithm does not need additional verification that a minimum is a duplicate of a previously found minimum, which also saves on simulator point computations. Finally, it finds minima that can be "hidden" by close larger minima.},

  abstract       = {Time series clustering is the process of grouping time series with respect to their similarity or characteristics. Previous approaches usually combine a specific distance measure for time series and a standard clustering method. However, these approaches do not take the similarity of the different subsequences of each time series into account, which can be used to better compare the time series objects of the dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel technique of time series clustering based on two clustering stages. In a first step, a least squares polynomial segmentation procedure is applied to each time series, which is based on a growing window technique that returns different-length segments. Then, all the segments are projected into same dimensional space, based on the coefficients of the model that approximates the segment and a set of statistical features. After mapping, a first hierarchical clustering phase is applied to all mapped segments, returning groups of segments for each time series. These clusters are used to represent all time series in the same dimensional space, after defining another specific mapping process. In a second and final clustering stage, all the time series objects are grouped. We consider internal clustering quality to automatically adjust the main parameter of the algorithm, which is an error threshold for the segmenta- tion. The results obtained on 84 datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive have been compared against two state-of-the-art methods, showing that the performance of this methodology is very promising.},

This naturally leads to new fund volume clustering that is correlated with the economic environment.

Mostly, such stocks with high value of correlation at some lead or lag belong to the same cluster (or sector).

Considering relations among dimensionality reduction, noise trading, and market situations, we empirically investigate the effect of dimensionality-reduction methods-principal component analysis, stacked autoencoder, and stacked restricted Boltzmann machine-on stock selection with cluster analysis in different market situations. Based on the index fluctuation, the market is divided into sideways and trend situations. For the CSI 100 and Nikkei 225 constituent stocks, experimental results show that: (1) in sideways situations, dimensionality reduction hardly improves the performance of stock selection with cluster analysis; (2) the advantage of dimensionality reduction is mainly reflected in trend situations, but whether it is in an up or down trend depends on the market analyzed. More importantly, according to the above findings and assuming that the dimensionality-reduction effect will continue, we propose a rotation strategy with and without dimensionality reduction. The results of experiments show that the proposed rotation strategy outperforms the stock market indices as well as the stock-selection strategies based on dimensionality reduction and cluster analysis. These findings offer practical insights into how dimensionality reduction can be efficiently used for stock selection.},

This work presents a novel method for learning hyperplane separators which minimise this graph cut objective, when data are embedded in Euclidean space. The optimisation problem associated with the proposed method can be formulated as a sequence of univariate subproblems, in which the optimal hyperplane orthogonal to a given vector is determined. These subproblems can be solved in log-linear time, by exploiting the trivial factorisation of the exponential function. Experimentation suggests that the empirical runtime of the overall algorithm is also log-linear in the number of data. Asymptotic properties of the minimum cut hyperplane, both for a finite sample, and for an increasing sample assumed to arise from an underlying probability distribution are discussed. In the finite sample case the minimum cut hyperplane converges to the maximum margin hyperplane as the scaling parameter is reduced to zero. Applying the proposed methodology, both for fixed scaling, and the large margin asymptotes, is shown to produce high quality clustering models in comparison with state-of-the-art clustering algorithms in experiments using a large collection of benchmark datasets.},

We extract statistical features over a sliding window of each time series, and then use a Gaussian mixture model to identify clusters which are then projected back on the data streams. The human analyst can then further analyze this projection and adjust the size of the sliding window and the number of clusters in order to capture the different types of clusters over different time scales. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two different application scenarios: (1) fleet management and (2) district heating, wherein each scenario, several different types of meaningful clusters can be identified when varying over these dimensions.},

  abstract             = {The key to time series clustering is how to characterize the similarity between any two time series. In this paper, we explore a new similarity metric called "cross-predictability": the degree to which a future value in each time series is predicted by past values of the others. However, it is challenging to estimate such cross-predictability among time series in the high-dimensional regime, where the number of time series is much larger than the length of each time series. We address this challenge with a sparsity assumption: only time series in the same cluster have significant cross-predictability with each other. We demonstrate that this approach is computationally attractive, and provide a theoretical proof that the proposed algorithm will identify the correct clustering structure with high probability under certain conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical high-dimensional time series clustering algorithm with a provable guarantee. We evaluate with experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data, and results indicate that our method can achieve more than 80\% clustering accuracy on real-world data, which is 20\% higher than the state-of-art baselines.},

  abstract             = {Clustering methods have led to a number of important discoveries in bioinformatics and beyond. A major challenge in their use is determining which clusters represent important underlying structure, as opposed to spurious sampling artifacts. This challenge is especially serious, and very few methods are available when the data are very high in dimension. Statistical Significance of Clustering (SigClust) is a recently developed cluster evaluation tool for high dimensional low sample size data. An important component of the SigClust approach is the very definition of a single cluster as a subset of data sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The implementation of SigClust requires the estimation of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix for the null multivariate Gaussian distribution. We show that the original eigenvalue estimation can lead to a test that suffers from severe inflation of type-I error, in the important case where there are huge single spikes in the eigenvalues. This paper addresses this critical challenge using a novel likelihood based soft thresholding approach to estimate these eigenvalues which leads to a much improved SigClust. These major improvements in SigClust performance are shown by both theoretical work and an extensive simulation study. Applications to some cancer genomic data further demonstrate the usefulness of these improvements.},

The goal is to study methods for the determination of hierarchical clusters, i.e., a family of nested partitions indexed by a resolution parameter, induced from the given distance intervals of the metric spaces. Our construction of hierarchical clustering methods is based on defining admissible methods to be those methods that abide to the axioms of value - nodes in a metric space with two nodes are clustered together at the convex combination of the distance bounds between them - and transformation - when both distance bounds are reduced, the output may become more clustered but not less. Two admissible methods are constructed and are shown to provide universal upper and lower bounds in the space of admissible methods. Practical implications are explored by clustering moving points via snapshots and by clustering networks representing brain structural connectivity using the lower and upper bounds of the network distance. The proposed clustering methods succeed in identifying underlying clustering structures via the maximum and minimum distances in all snapshots, as well as in differentiating brain connectivity networks of patients from those of healthy controls.},

We analyze the dynamic correlation network of selected Japanese stock returns as an empirical study of the correlation dynamics at the market level by applying the proposed method. Two types of network clustering algorithms are employed for the dimensionality reduction. Firstly, several stock groups instead of the existing business sector classification are generated by the hierarchical recursive network clustering of filtered stock returns in order to overcome the high dimensionality problem due to the large number of stocks. The stock returns are then filtered in advance to control for volatility fluctuations that can distort the correlation between stocks. Thus, the correlation network of individual stock returns is transformed into a correlation network of group-based portfolio returns. Secondly, the reduced size of the correlation network is extended to a dynamic one by using a model-based correlation estimation method. A time series of adjacency matrices is created on a daily basis as a dynamic correlation network from the estimation results. Then, the correlation network is summarized into only three representative correlation networks by clustering along the time axis. Some intertemporal comparisons of the dynamic correlation network are conducted by examining the differences between the three sub-period networks. Our dynamic correlation network analysis framework is not limited to stock returns, but can be applied to many other financial and non-financial volatile time series data.},

When dealing with time series, selecting a suitable measure to evaluate the similarities/dissimilarities within the data becomes necessary and subsequently it exhibits a significant impact on the results of clustering. This selection should be based upon the nature of time series and the application itself. When grouping time series based on their shape information is of interest (shape-based clustering), using a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance is a desirable choice. Using stretching or compressing segments of temporal data, DTW determines an optimal match between any two time series. In this way, time series exhibiting similar patterns occurring at different time periods, are considered as being similar. Although DTW is a suitable choice for comparing data with respect to their shape information, calculating the average of a collection of time series (which is required in clustering methods) based on this distance becomes a challenging problem. As the result, employing clustering techniques like K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means (where the cluster centers - prototypes are calculated through averaging the data) along with the DTW distance is a challenging task and may produce unsatisfactory results. In this study, three alternatives for fuzzy clustering of time series using DTW distance are proposed. In the first method, a DTW-based averaging technique proposed in the literature, has been applied to the Fuzzy C-Means clustering. The second method considers a Fuzzy C-Medoids clustering, while the third alternative comes as a hybrid technique, which exploits the advantages of both the Fuzzy C-Means and Fuzzy C-Medoids when clustering time series. Experimental studies are reported over a set of time series coming from the UCR time series database.},

Unfortunately, there is not always enough historical data to forecast items individually- this is particularly true in e-commerce where there is a long tail of low selling items, and items are introduced and phased out quite frequently, unlike physical stores. In such scenarios, it is preferable to forecast items in well-designed groups of similar items, so that data for different items can be pooled together to fit a single model. In this paper, we first discuss the desiderata for such a grouping and how it differs from the traditional clustering problem. We then describe our approach which is a scalable local search heuristic that can naturally handle the constraints required in this setting, besides being capable of producing solutions competitive with well-known clustering algorithms. We also address the complementary problem of estimating similarity, particularly in the case of new items which have no past sales. Our solution is to regress the sales profile of items against their semantic features, so that given just the semantic features of a new item we can predict its relation to other items, in terms of as yet unobserved sales. Our experiments demonstrate both the scalability of our approach and implications for forecast accuracy.},

A clustering analysis is then performed to study the market structure given by the partial correlation analysis and the members of the clusters are compared with the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). The initial hypothesis is that the firms in the same GICS sector are clustered together since they are in a similar business and environment.

  abstract       = {Recently there has been an increase in the studies on time-series data mining specifically time-series clustering due to the vast existence of time-series in various domains. The large volume of data in the form of time-series makes it necessary to employ various techniques such as clustering to understand the data and to extract information and hidden patterns. In the field of clustering specifically, time-series clustering, the most important aspects are the similarity measure used and the algorithm employed to conduct the clustering. In this paper, a new similarity measure for time-series clustering is developed based on a combination of a simple representation of time-series, slope of each segment of time-series, Euclidean distance and the so-called dynamic time warping. It is proved in this paper that the proposed distance measure is metric and thus indexing can be applied. For the task of clustering, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is employed. The proposed similarity measure is compared to three existing measures in terms of various criteria used for the evaluation of clustering algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed similarity measure outperforms the rest in almost every dataset used in this paper.},

Nuclear norm is a convex relaxation for this problem which can recover the rank exactly under some restricted and theoretically interesting conditions. However, for many real-world applications, nuclear norm approximation to the rank function can only produce a result far from the optimum. To seek a solution of higher accuracy than the nuclear norm, in this letter, we propose a rank approximation based on Logarithm-Determinant. We consider using this rank approximation for subspace clustering application. Our framework can model different kinds of errors and noise. Effective optimization strategy is developed with theoretical guarantee to converge to a stationary point. The proposed method gives promising results on face clustering and motion segmentation tasks compared to the state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms.},

  abstract             = {Many similarity-based clustering methods work in two separate steps including similarity matrix computation and subsequent spectral clustering. However, similarity measurement is challenging because it is usually impacted by many factors, e.g., the choice of similarity metric, neighborhood size, scale of data, noise and outliers. Thus the learned similarity matrix is often not suitable, let alone optimal, for the subsequent clustering. In addition, nonlinear similarity often exists in many real world data which, however, has not been effectively considered by most existing methods. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a model to simultaneously learn cluster indicator matrix and similarity information in kernel spaces in a principled way. We show theoretical relationships to kernel k-means, k-means, and spectral clustering methods. Then, to address the practical issue of how to select the most suitable kernel for a particular clustering task, we further extend our model with a multiple kernel learning ability. With this joint model, we can automatically accomplish three subtasks of finding the best cluster indicator matrix, the most accurate similarity relations and the optimal combination of multiple kernels. By leveraging the interactions between these three subtasks in a joint framework, each subtask can be iteratively boosted by using the results of the others towards an overall optimal solution. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

Clustering algorithms do not offer a systematic answer to this simple question. Hence we propose a new framework that can, for the first time, explain cluster assignments in terms of input features in a comprehensive manner. It is based on the novel theoretical insight that clustering models can be rewritten as neural networks, or 'neuralized'. Predictions of the obtained networks can then be quickly and accurately attributed to the input features. Several showcases demonstrate the ability of our method to assess the quality of learned clusters and to extract novel insights from the analyzed data and representations.},

In this analysis, we compare ten model-based clustering methods in terms of their ability to identify such features under four scenarios in which data are simulated with varying levels of variable and temporal dependence. To consider these methods in a realistic environment, we focus our analysis on wind data, where observations are often strongly correlated in time, and the dependence of variables is known to vary across different regional weather patterns. In particular, we assess each method's performance when applied to wind data simulated under a realistic two-regime Markov-switching vector autoregressive (VAR) model with a diurnally varying mean. A Gaussian mixture model and a basic Markov-switching model outperform the other methods considered in terms of misclassification rates and number of clusters identified. These two methods and an additional Markov-switching VAR model are then applied to one year of averaged hourly wind data from twenty meteorological stations, and we find that the methods can identify very different features in the data.

The time series are either given in one batch (offline setting), or they are allowed to grow with time and new time series can be added along the way (online setting). We propose a natural notion of consistency for this problem, and show that there are simple, computationally efficient algorithms that are asymptotically consistent under extremely weak assumptions on the distributions that generate the data. The notion of consistency is as follows. A clustering algorithm is called consistent if it places two time series into the same cluster if and only if the distribution that generates them is the same. In the considered framework the time series are allowed to be highly dependent, and the dependence can have arbitrary form. If the number of clusters is known, the only assumption we make is that the (marginal) distribution of each time series is stationary ergodic. No parametric, memory or mixing assumptions are made. When the number of clusters is unknown, stronger assumptions are provably necessary, but it is still possible to devise nonparametric algorithms that are consistent under very general conditions. The theoretical findings of this work are illustrated with experiments on both synthetic and real data.},

Our objective is to estimate the distributions of the sources. A standard approach to this problem is to model the data as a hidden Markov model (HMM). However, since the data often lacks the Markov or the stationarity properties of an HMM, one can ask whether this approach is still suitable or perhaps another approach is required. In this paper we show that a maximum likelihood HMM estimator can be used to approximate the source distributions in a much larger class of models than HMMs. Specifically, we propose a natural and fairly general non-stationary model of the data, where the only restriction is that the sources do not change too often. Our main result shows that for this model, a maximum-likelihood HMM estimator produces the correct second moment of the data, and the results can be extended to higher moments.},

We use a two-phased experimental approach with visualizations to explore the effects of the different clustering techniques. The choice of clustering technique matters. There is significant variation among techniques, resulting in different "pictures"of the riskiness of the same underlying data when plotted to the visual analytics tool. This sensitivity to clustering methodolgy has the potential to mislead analysts about the riskiness of portfolios. We conclude that further research into the implications of portfolio formation rules is needed, and that visual analytics tools should not limit analysts to a single clustering technique, but instead should provide the facility to explore the data using different techniques.},

Three different rebalancing periods are tested: every 1, 2 and 4 hours. The results show that all clustering algorithms produce more stable portfolios with similar volatility. In this sense, the portfolios volatilities generated by the clustering algorithms are smaller when compare to the portfolio obtained using classical Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) over all the dataset.

Seasonal forecasting consists in forecasting the whole next season for a given seasonal time series. It may help a service provider to provision correctly the potentially required resources, avoiding critical situations of over- or under provision. In this article, we propose a generic framework to make seasonal time series forecasting. The framework combines machine learning techniques (1) to identify the typical seasons and (2) to forecast the likelihood of having a season type in one season ahead. We study this framework by comparing the mean squared errors of forecasts for various settings and various datasets. The best setting is then compared to state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods. We show that it is competitive with them.},

It's value comes with the ability to extract meaningful patterns that are of economic, societal or scientific relevance. A particular challenge is to identify patterns across time, including patterns that might only become apparent when the temporal dimension is taken into account. Here, we present a novel method that aims to achieve this by detecting dynamic clusters, i.e. structural elements that can be present over prolonged durations. It is based on an adaptive identification of majority overlaps between groups at different time points and allows the accommodation of transient decompositions in otherwise persistent dynamic clusters. As such, our method enables the detection of persistent structural elements with internal dynamics and can be applied to any classifiable data, ranging from social contact networks to arbitrary sets of time stamped feature vectors. It provides a unique tool to study systems with non-trivial temporal dynamics with a broad applicability to scientific, societal and economic data.},

To address this issue, we propose a new mixture model called Hidden Markov Model on Variable Blocks (HMM-VB) and a new mode search algorithm called Modal Baum-Welch (MBW) for mode-association clustering. HMM-VB leverages prior information about chain-like dependence among groups of variables to achieve the effect of dimension reduction. In case such a dependence structure is unknown or assumed merely for the sake of parsimonious modeling, we develop a recursive search algorithm based on BIC to optimize the formation of ordered variable blocks. The MBW algorithm ensures the feasibility of clustering via mode association, achieving linear complexity in terms of the number of variable blocks despite the exponentially growing number of possible state sequences in HMM-VB. In addition, we provide theoretical investigations about the identifiability of HMM-VB as well as the consistency of our approach to search for the block partition of variables in a special case. Experiments on simulated and real data show that our proposed method outperforms other widely used methods.},

The adopted procedure claims the feature of producing a partition of funds that are readily interpretable from a financial point of view and it is further possible to rank the identified groups, thus obtaining a rating of funds that turns out to account for different propensities toward the risk exposure.},

The proposed method, namely, the MMCC method, aims to achieve high approximation accuracy and computational efficiency by combining an improved moment-matching (MM) method with the clustering (C) method and the Cholesky decomposition (CD) method. First, the C method is used to reduce the number of OSs by minimising the space distance between the reduced scenarios (RSs) and the OSs. Next, the CD method is used to rectify the correlation of the RSs to satisfy that of the ODPD. Finally, the RS probabilities are optimally determined by the MM method in order to minimise the stochastic features (first four moments and correlation matrix) between the RDPD and the ODPD. Simulations of RDPD approximation for three wind farms with 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 scenarios were carried out using the Latin hypercube sampling, importance sampling, C, moment-matching-clustering (MMC), and MMCC methods.

In our new portfolio strategy, central, peripheral and dispersed portfolios constructed from clusters detected using unweighted and weighted modularity are compared according to their past performances, and the optimal portfolio is used in the investment period only if the market index return predicted by the LR, WMA or BP models is positive to avoid losses when the market drops. Our strategy is tested using the daily data of Chinese A-share market from January 4, 2008 and December 31, 2016, and the average investment return during different moving investment periods and 200 repeated runs is calculated. We find that although incorporating dispersed portfolio into our strategy has no significant effect in raising the investment return, it shows a similar performance as the peripheral portfolio, and the strategy constructed using unweighted modularity generally outperforms its counterpart by using weighted modularity. In addition, the market trend prediction can refine the investment return of our strategy. In brief, the strategy constructed using the BP model and unweighted modularity has the best investment return, which also outperforms the Markowitz portfolio.},

Then we propose a new similarity metric incorporating both the potential field which represents global data distribution information and the distance matrix which represents local data distribution information. Finally we develop another equivalent similarity metric based on an edge weighted tree of all the data points, which leads to a fast agglomerative clustering algorithm with time complexity O(N2). The proposed PHA method is evaluated by comparing with six other typical agglomerative clustering methods on four synthetic data sets and two real data sets. Experiments show that it runs much faster than the other methods and produces the most satisfying results in most cases. A potential field is used to represent global data distribution information.

Hierarchical clustering algorithms are deterministic, stable, and do not need a pre-determined number of clusters as input. However, they are not scalable for very large data due to their non-linear complexity.

The proposed method has the following components: (i) A new combination similarity based on common-neighbours of graph theory is proposed, (ii) In every iteration, instead of calculating the centroids for new clusters, new centroids are estimated from centroids in previous iteration, and (iii) In each iteration, instead of merging only one pair of objects, multiple pairs are merged at the same time. In addition to the proposed combination similarity, four well-known methods including centroid-based, group-based, complete-link, and single-link, have been also implemented. All five methods are tested and evaluated using two metrics: purity and imbalance or chaining factor. We show that our proposed algorithm outperforms other classic methods.},

  abstract       = {Variable selection in cluster analysis is important yet challenging. It can be achieved by regularization methods, which realize a trade-off between the clustering accuracy and the number of selected variables by using a lasso-type penalty. However, the calibration of the penalty term can suffer from criticisms. Model selection methods are an efficient alternative, yet they require a difficult optimization of an information criterion which involves combinatorial problems. First, most of these optimization algorithms are based on a suboptimal procedure (e.g. stepwise method). Second, the algorithms are often computationally expensive because they need multiple calls of EM algorithms. Here we propose to use a new information criterion based on the integrated complete-data likelihood. It does not require the maximum likelihood estimate and its maximization appears to be simple and computationally efficient. The original contribution of our approach is to perform the model selection without requiring any parameter estimation. Then, parameter inference is needed only for the unique selected model. This approach is used for the variable selection of a Gaussian mixture model with conditional independence assumed. The numerical experiments on simulated and benchmark datasets show that the proposed method often outperforms two classical approaches for variable selection. The proposed approach is implemented in the R package VarSelLCM available on CRAN.},

Some of the clusters centers can be used to parameterize a novel dependence coefficient which can target or forget specific dependence patterns. Finally, we illustrate and benchmark the methodology on several datasets. Code and numerical experiments are available online for reproducible research.},

One key component in cluster analysis is determining a proper dissimilarity measure between two data objects, and many criteria have been proposed in the literature to assess dissimilarity between two time series. The R package TSclust is aimed to implement a large set of well-established peer-reviewed time series dissimilarity measures, including measures based on raw data, extracted features, underlying parametric models, complexity levels, and forecast behaviors. Computation of these measures allows the user to perform clustering by using conventional clustering algorithms. TSclust also includes a clustering procedure based on p values from checking the equality of generating models, and some utilities to evaluate cluster solutions. The implemented dissimilarity functions are accessible individually for an easier extension and possible use out of the clustering context. The main features of TSclust are described and examples of its use are presented.},

This paper first reviews existing methods for selecting the number of clusters for the algorithm. Factors that affect this selection are then discussed and an improvement of the existing k-means algorithm to assist the selection is proposed. The paper concludes with an analysis of the results of using cluster validation referring to some measures that are classified as internal and external indexes to determine the optimal number of clusters for the K-means algorithm. There are applied some stopping criterion referring to those indexes for evaluating a clustering against a gold standard.},

The maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of MoAR models requires evaluating products of large numbers of densities of normal random variables. In practical scenarios, these products converge to zero as the length of the time series increases, and thus the ML estimation of MoAR models becomes infeasible without the use of numerical tricks. We propose a maximum pseudolikelihood (MPL) estimation approach as an alternative to the use of numerical tricks. The MPL estimator is proved to be consistent and can be computed with an EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm. Simulations are used to assess the performance of the MPL estimator against that of the ML estimator in cases where the latter was able to be calculated. An application to the clustering of time series data arising from a resting state fMRI experiment is presented as a demonstration of the methodology.},

Empirical results based on model data show that the clearer cluster structure corresponds to a smaller dimension. We use the algorithm to verify the relationship between the cluster structure of the real market data and the correlation dimension. The correlation dimensions in the financial market are calculated and used as a measure to study the cluster structure in the correlation coefficient matrix. First, based on the existing model, we present a toy model. Using the model-generated data, we find that the clearer cluster structure corresponds to a smaller dimension. It implies that the correlation dimension can be used as a measure of the cluster structure in the correlation coefficient matrix. Finally, we use the algorithm to compute the clusters in the real market and verify the previous empirical evidence. The results show that the cluster structure in the financial correlation coefficient matrix may change with time. The correlation dimension is smaller after the financial crisis, indicating that the cluster structure is clearer after the financial crisis.},

This finding is important in asset pricing, derivatives pricing, and risk management. Volatility clustering is a well-known stylized feature of financial asset returns. This paper investigates asymmetric pattern in volatility clustering by employing a univariate copula approach of Chen and Fan (2006). Using daily realized kernel volatilities constructed from high frequency data from stock and foreign exchange markets, we find evidence that volatility clustering is highly nonlinear and strongly asymmetric in that clusters of high volatility occur more often than clusters of low volatility. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to address and uncover this phenomenon. In particular, the asymmetry in volatility clustering is found to be more pronounced in the stock markets than in the foreign exchange markets. Further, the volatility clusters are shown to remain persistent for over a month and asymmetric across different time periods. Our findings have important implications for risk management. A simulation study indicates that models which accommodate asymmetric volatility clustering can significantly improve the out-of-sample forecasts of Value-at-Risk},

The risk is generally linked to the volatility of the asset, but its level of predictability also plays a basic role in investment decisions. In particular, the classification of a certain asset could be linked to its dependence on the volatility of a dominant market: movements in the volatility of the dominant market can provide similar movements in the volatility of the asset and its predictability would depend on the strength of this dependence. Working in a model based framework, we base the classification of the volatility of an asset not only on its volatility level, but also on the presence of spillover effects from a dominant market, such as the US one, and on the similarity of the dynamics of the asset and the dominant market. The method is carried out using an extended version of the Multiplicative Error Model and is applied to a set of European assets, also performing a historical simulation experiment.},

The clustering process is applied to choose the preferred assets among hundreds of assets provided in the market under the related features.

The used data is the daily close price of 175 assets in Indonesian exchange (IDX). We perform 4 clustering algorithms to locate the assets that have the same similarity into the same cluster. Since the four features are being considered, the spherical-shape of data is difficult to observe. In fact, the portfolio return of all algorithm's outcome show the Agglomerative and DBScan algorithm yield higher performance evaluation with no dominant asset included. Assets representatives from each cluster are determined to be in the portfolio formation. By using the portfolio theory by Markowitz, i.e Mean-variance optimization (MVO) and Sharp ration optimization, the proportion of contained assets are computed, and we test their performance by applying the formation into the market data a month after as a testing data. Several interesting results are provided.},

Clustering is one of the most popular data-mining methods, not only due to its exploratory power but also because it is often a preprocessing step or subroutine for other techniques. In this article, we present k-Shape and k-MultiShapes (k-MS), two novel algorithms for time-series clustering. k-Shape and k-MS rely on a scalable iterative refinement procedure. As their distance measure, k-Shape and k-MS use shape-based distance (SBD), a normalized version of the cross-correlation measure, to consider the shapes of time series while comparing them. Based on the properties of SBD, we develop two new methods, namely ShapeExtraction (SE) and MultiShapesExtraction (MSE), to compute cluster centroids that are used in every iteration to update the assignment of time series to clusters. k-Shape relies on SE to compute a single centroid per cluster based on all time series in each cluster. In contrast, k-MS relies on MSE to compute multiple centroids per cluster to account for the proximity and spatial distribution of time series in each cluster. To demonstrate the robustness of SBD, k-Shape, and k-MS, we perform an extensive experimental evaluation on 85 datasets against state-of-the-art distance measures and clustering methods for time series using rigorous statistical analysis. SBD, our efficient and parameter-free distance measure, achieves similar accuracy to Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a highly accurate but computationally expensive distance measure that requires parameter tuning. For clustering, we compare k-Shape and k-MS against scalable and non-scalable partitional, hierarchical, spectral, density-based, and shapelet-based methods, with combinations of the most competitive distance measures. k-Shape outperforms all scalable methods in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, k-Shape also outperforms all non-scalable approaches, with one exception, namely k-medoids with DTW, which achieves similar accuracy. However, unlike k-Shape, this approach requires tuning of its distance measure and is significantly slower than k-Shape. k-MS performs similarly to k-Shape in comparison to rival methods, but k-MS is significantly more accurate than k-Shape. Beyond clustering, we demonstrate the effectiveness of k-Shape to reduce the search space of one-nearest-neighbor classifiers for time series. Overall, SBD, k-Shape, and k-MS emerge as domain-independent, highly accurate, and efficient methods for time-series comparison and clustering with broad applications.},

  abstract       = {The only input to attain the portfolio weights of global minimum variance portfolio (GMVP) is the covariance matrix of returns of assets being considered for investment. Since the population covariance matrix is not known, investors use historical data to estimate it. Even though sample covariance matrix is an unbiased estimator of the population covariance matrix, it includes a great amount of estimation error especially when the number of observed data is not much bigger than number of assets. As it is difficult to estimate the covariance matrix with high dimensionality all at once, clustering stocks is proposed to come up with covariance matrix in two steps: firstly, within a cluster and secondly, between clusters. It decreases the estimation error by reducing the number of features in the data matrix. The motivation of this dissertation is that the estimation error can still remain high even after clustering, if a large amount of stocks is clustered together in a single group. This research proposes to utilize a bounded clustering method in order to limit the maximum cluster size. The result of experiments shows that not only the gap between in-sample volatility and out-of-sample volatility decreases, but also the out-of-sample volatility gets reduced. It implies that we need a bounded clustering algorithm so that maximum clustering size can be precisely controlled to find the best portfolio performance.},

Different approaches could be adopted to tackle the classification problem: statistical tools may contribute to increase the degree of confidence in the classification scheme. A classification algorithm for mutual funds style analysis is proposed, which combines different statistical techniques and exploits information readily available at low cost. Objective, representative, consistent and empirically testable classification schemes are strongly sought for in this field in order to give reliable information to investors and fund managers who are interested in evaluating and comparing different financial products. Institutional classification schemes, when available, do not always provide consistent and representative peer groups of funds. A "return-based"classification scheme is proposed, which aims at identifying mutual funds' styles by analysing time series of past returns. The proposed classification procedure consists of three basic steps: (a) a dimensionality reduction step based on principal component analysis, (b) a clustering step that exploits a robust evolutionary clustering methodology, and (c) a style identification step via a constrained regression model first proposed by William Sharpe. The algorithm is tested on a sample of Italian mutual funds and achieves satisfactory results with respect to (i) the agreement with the existing institutional classification and (ii) the explanatory power of out of sample variability in the cross-section of returns.},

The weight of the link (i, j), which quantifies the similarity between the two corresponding time series, is defined according to a metric based on symbolic time series analysis, which has recently proved effective in the context of financial time series. Then, searching for network communities allows one to identify groups of nodes (and then time series) with strong similarity. A quantitative assessment of the significance of the obtained partition is also provided. The method is applied to two distinct case-studies concerning the US and Italy Stock Exchange, respectively. In the US case, the stability of the partitions over time is also thoroughly investigated. The results favorably compare with those obtained with the standard tools typically used for clustering financial time series, such as the minimal spanning tree and the hierarchical tree.},

Once the assets are hierarchically clustered, the authors compute a simple and efficient capital allocation within and across clusters of assets, so that many correlated assets receive the same total allocation as a single uncorrelated one. The out-of-sample performances of hierarchical clustering-based portfolios and more traditional risk-based portfolios are evaluated across three disparate datasets, which differ in term of the number of assets and the assets' composition. To avoid data snooping, the authors assess the comparison of profit measures using the bootstrap-based model confidence set procedure. Their empirical results indicate that hierarchical clustering-based portfolios are robust and truly diversified and achieve statistically better risk-adjusted performances than commonly used portfolio optimization techniques.},

Bayesian posterior samples for the latent allocation variables can be effectively obtained in a wide range of clustering models, including finite mixtures, infinite mixtures, hidden Markov models and block models for networks. However, due to the categorical nature of the clustering variables and the lack of scalable algorithms, summary tools that can interpret such samples are not available. We adopt a Bayesian decision theoretical approach to define an optimality criterion for clusterings and propose a fast and context-independent greedy algorithm to find the best allocations. One important facet of our approach is that the optimal number of groups is automatically selected, thereby solving the clustering and the model-choice problems at the same time. We consider several loss functions to compare partitions and show that our approach can accommodate a wide range of cases. Finally, we illustrate our approach on both artificial and real datasets for three different clustering models: Gaussian mixtures, stochastic block models and latent block models for networks.},

Both sector membership and geography combine to create a complex clustering structure where companies seem to first be divided based on sector, with geographical subclusters emerging within each industrial sector. We argue that standard techniques for detecting overlapping clusters and communities are not able to capture this type of structure, and show how robust regression techniques can instead be used to remove the influence of both sector and geography from the correlation matrix separately. Our analysis reveals that prior to the 2008 financial crisis, companies did not tend to form clusters based on geography. This changed immediately following the crisis, with geography becoming a more important determinant of clustering.},

It was also shown in (Dasgupta, 2016) that a top-down algorithm based on the uniform Sparsest Cut problem returns a hierarchical clustering of cost at most O(alpha n log n)O(alpha n log n) times the cost of the optimal hierarchical clustering, where alpha is the approximation ratio of the Sparsest Cut subroutine used. Thus using the best known approximation algorithm for Sparsest Cut due to Arora-Rao- Vazirani, the top-down algorithm returns a hierarchical clustering of cost at most O(log 3/2n)O(log 3/2n) times the cost of the optimal solution. We improve this by giving an O(log n)O(log n))-approximation algorithm for this problem. Our main technical ingredients are a combinatorial characterization of ultrametrics induced by this cost function, deriving an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for this family of ultrametrics, and showing how to iteratively round an LP relaxation of this formulation by using the idea of sphere growing which has been extensively used in the context of graph partitioning. We also prove that our algorithm returns an O(log n)O(log n)- approximate hierarchical clustering for a generalization of this cost function also studied in (Dasgupta, 2016). Experiments show that the hierarchies found by using the ILP formulation as well as our rounding algorithm often have better projections into flat clusters than the standard linkage based algorithms. We conclude with constant factor inapproximability results for this problem: 1) no polynomial size LP or SDP can achieve a constant factor approximation for this problem and 2) no polynomial time algorithm can achieve a constant factor approximation under the Small Set Expansion hypothesis.},

The standard K-Means algorithm and CLARA algorithm has been considered as testing models. Four standard data sets, namely Iris, Seeds, Wine and Flame data sets has been chosen for testing the performance of the indices. The performance of the indices with the increasing number of parameters of the data set is measured. The results are compared and analyzed.},

Complex networks describe a widespread variety of systems in nature and society especially systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical entities. Complex networks like real networks can also have community structure. There are several types of methods and algorithms for detection and identification of communities in complex networks. Several complex networks have the property of clustering or network transitivity. Some of the important concepts in the field of complex networks are small-world and scale-robustness, degree distributions, clustering, network correlations, random graph models, models of network growth, dynamical processes on networks, etc. Some current areas of research on complex network communities are those on community evolution, overlapping communities, communities in directed networks, community characterization and interpretation, etc. Many of the algorithms or methods proposed for network community detection through clustering are modified versions of or inspired from the concepts of minimum-cut based algorithms, hierarchical connectivity based algorithms, the original GirvanNewman algorithm, concepts of modularity maximization, algorithms utilizing metrics from information and coding theory, and clique based algorithms.},

This distance is computationally expensive, so many related optimizations have been developed over the years. Since no single clustering algorithm can be said to perform best on all datasets, different strategies must be tested and compared, so a common infrastructure can be advantageous. In this manuscript, a general overview of time-series clustering is given, including many specifics related to Dynamic Time Warping and other recently proposed techniques. At the same time, a description of the dtwclust package for the R statistical software is provided, showcasing how it can be used to evaluate many different time-series clustering procedures.},

The method of weighted rank aggregation is utilized by this package to objectively aggregate various performance measure scores, thereby taking away the guesswork that often follows a visual inspection of cluster results.

Despite this, the evaluation of class separations is often subjective and performed via visualization. Here we present the ClusterSignificance package; a set of tools designed to assess the statistical significance of class separations downstream of dimensionality reduction algorithms. In addition, we demonstrate the design and utility of the ClusterSignificance package and utilize it to determine the importance of long non-coding RNA expression in the identity of multiple hematological malignancies.

Due to the personalized nature of document clustering, even the best fully automatic algorithms cannot create clusters that accurately reflect the user's perspectives. To incorporate the users perspective in the clustering process and, at the same time, effectively visualize document collections to enhance user's sense-making of data, we propose a novel visual analytics system for interactive document clustering. We built our system on top of clustering algorithms that can adapt to user's feedback. First, the initial clustering is created based on the user-defined number of clusters and the selected clustering algorithm. Second, the clustering result is visualized to the user. A collection of coordinated visualization modules and document projection is designed to guide the user towards a better insight into the document collection and clusters. The user changes clusters and key-terms iteratively as a feedback to the clustering algorithm until the result is satisfactory. In key-term based interaction, the user assigns a set of key-terms to each target cluster to guide the clustering algorithm. A set of quantitative experiments, a use case, and a user study have been conducted to show the advantages of the approach for document analytics based on clustering.},

For a planar embedding, this method provides both the intra-cluster hierarchy, which describes the way clusters are composed, and the inter-cluster hierarchy which describes how clusters gather together. We discuss performance, robustness and reliability of this method by first investigating several artificial data-sets, finding that it can outperform significantly other established approaches. Then we show that our method can successfully differentiate meaningful clusters and hierarchies in a variety of real data-sets. In particular, we find that the application to gene expression patterns of lymphoma samples uncovers biologically significant groups of genes which play key-roles in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of some of the most relevant human lymphoid malignancies.},

Simulations show that these efficient sampling schemes can lead to substantial savings in computation time in Monte Carlo procedures involving discrete indicators.

In particular, given two models from the same parametric family of distributions, one can define the distance between these models as the length of the shortest geodesic connecting them in a Riemannian manifold whose metric is given by the model Fisher Information matrix. One limitation that had hinder the adoption of this similarity measure in practical applications is that this distance is typically difficult to compute in a robust manner. We review such complications and provide a general form for the distance function for one parameter models. We next focus on two higher dimensional extreme value models including the Generalized Pareto and Generalized Extreme Value distributions that will be used in financial risk applications. Specifically, we first develop a technique to identify the nearest neighbors of a target security in the sense that their best fit model distributions have minimal Fisher distance to that of target. Second, we develop a hierarchical clustering technique that compares Generalized Extreme Value distributions fit to block maxima of a set of equity loss distributions to group together securities whose worst single day yearly loss distributions exhibit commonalities.},

  abstract       = {A major challenge in cluster analysis is that the number of data clusters is mostly unknown and it must be estimated prior to clustering the observed data. In real-world applications, the observed data is often subject to heavy tailed noise and outliers which obscure the true underlying structure of the data. Consequently, estimating the number of clusters becomes challenging. To this end, we derive a robust cluster enumeration criterion by formulating the problem of estimating the number of clusters as maximization of the posterior probability of multivariate t candidate models. We utilize Bayes' theorem and asymptotic approximations to come up with a robust criterion that possesses a closed-form expression. Further, we refine the derivation and provide a robust cluster enumeration criterion for the finite sample regime. The robust criteria require an estimate of cluster parameters for each candidate model as an input. Hence, we propose a two-step cluster enumeration algorithm that uses the expectation maximization algorithm to partition the data and estimate cluster parameters prior to the calculation of one of the robust criteria. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested and compared to existing cluster enumeration methods using numerical and real data experiments.},

  abstract             = {Four of the most common limitations of the many available clustering methods are: i) the lack of a proper strategy to deal with outliers; ii) the need for a good a priori estimate of the number of clusters to obtain reasonable results; iii) the lack of a method able to detect when partitioning of a specific data set is not appropriate; and iv) the dependence of the result on the initialization. Here we propose Cross-clustering (CC), a partial clustering algorithm that overcomes these four limitations by combining the principles of two well established hierarchical clustering algorithms: Ward's minimum variance and Complete-linkage. We validated CC by comparing it with a number of existing clustering methods, including Ward's and Complete-linkage. We show on both simulated and real datasets, that CC performs better than the other methods in terms of: the identification of the correct number of clusters, the identification of outliers, and the determination of real cluster memberships. We used CC to cluster samples in order to identify disease subtypes, and on gene profiles, in order to determine groups of genes with the same behavior. Results obtained on a non-biological dataset show that the method is general enough to be successfully used in such diverse applications. The algorithm has been implemented in the statistical language R and is freely available from the CRAN contributed packages repository.},

The predicted and realized risk level and the relative portfolio composition of the selected portfolio for a given value of the portfolio return are also investigated for each considered filtering method.

We prove in particular that correlation clustering can be solved in polynomial time when the underlying matrix is positive semidefinite with small constant rank, but that the task remains NP-hard in the presence of even one negative eigenvalue. Based on our theoretical results, we develop an algorithm for efficiently ``solving'' low-rank positive semidefinite correlation clustering by employing a procedure for zonotope vertex enumeration. We demonstrate the effectiveness and speed of our algorithm by using it to solve several clustering problems on both synthetic and real-world data.},

We use the factor model to study how the log volatility contributes to volatility clustering, quantifying the strength of the volatility clustering using a new nonparametric integrated proxy. Indeed finding a link between volatility and volatility clustering, we find that a global analysis reveals that only the market contributes to the volatility clustering. A local analysis reveals that for some clusters, the cluster itself contributes statistically to the volatility clustering effect. This is significantly advantageous over other factor models, since it offers a way of selecting factors in a statistical way, whilst also keeping economically relevant factors. Finally, we show that the log volatility factor model explains a similar amount of memory to a principal components analysis factor model and an exploratory factor model.},

We find the respective coefficients of determination (R2)(R2) are close for DT models, while finding an advantage to NNS in ST and large sample cases. Regression coefficients are sometimes regarded as approximations to partial derivatives, especially in social sciences. Then, NNS alone has the ability to compute a range of partials evaluated at points within the sample and also out-of-sample. Thus NNS can provide a viable alternative to kernel based nonparametric regressions without using bandwidths for smoothing.},

This article is intended to present working examples of several classification problems using NNS clustering analysis.

We demonstrate how NNS clustering is quite effective, as well as an alternative method NNS employs for classification tasks. We compare predictions of test sets with NNS, k-means using the "cl.predict" routine offered in R to "predict class ids or memberships from R objects representing partitions", K nearest neighbors classification using the "knn" routine in R-package "class", and a naive Bayes classification using the "e1071" package.

The methods and results presented immediately raise suspicions on the pervasive notion of dimension reduction given the consistent performance of the NNS Multivariate Regression.},

Each series within a cluster is assumed to follow the same model and the data are then pooled for estimation. The classification is model-based and robust to outlier contamination. The robustness is achieved by using the intrinsic mode functions of the Hilbert-Huang transform at lower frequencies.

These functions are found to be robust to outlier contamination. The paper also compares out-of-sample forecast performance of the proposed method with several methods available in the literature. The other forecasting methods considered include vector autoregressive models with or without LASSO, group LASSO, principal component regression, and partial least squares.

The proposed method is found to perform well in out-of-sample forecasting of the monthly unemployment rates of 50 US states.},

  abstract       = {BACKGROUND: Cluster analysis is the most common unsupervised method for finding hidden groups in data. Clustering presents two main challenges: (1) finding the optimal number of clusters, and (2) removing "outliers" among the objects being clustered. Few clustering algorithms currently deal directly with the outlier problem. Furthermore, existing methods for identifying the number of clusters still have some drawbacks. Thus, there is a need for a better algorithm to tackle both challenges. RESULTS: We present a new approach, implemented in an R package called Thresher, to cluster objects in general datasets. Thresher combines ideas from principal component analysis, outlier filtering, and von Mises-Fisher mixture models in order to select the optimal number of clusters. We performed a large Monte Carlo simulation study to compare Thresher with other methods for detecting outliers and determining the number of clusters. We found that Thresher had good sensitivity and specificity for detecting and removing outliers. We also found that Thresher is the best method for estimating the optimal number of clusters when the number of objects being clustered is smaller than the number of variables used for clustering. Finally, we applied Thresher and eleven other methods to 25 sets of breast cancer data downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus; only Thresher consistently estimated the number of clusters to lie in the range of 4-7 that is consistent with the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Thresher is effective at automatically detecting and removing outliers. By thus cleaning the data, it produces better estimates of the optimal number of clusters when there are more variables than objects. When we applied Thresher to a variety of breast cancer datasets, it produced estimates that were both self-consistent and consistent with the literature. We expect Thresher to be useful for studying a wide variety of biological datasets.},

However, these algorithmic combinations are often ad hoc or disconnected, working independently and in parallel rather than integrating some degree of interdependence. A number of design decisions must be addressed when employing dimension reduction and clustering algorithms concurrently in a visualization system, including the selection of each algorithm, the order in which they are processed, and how to present and interact with the resulting projection. This paper contributes an overview of combining dimension reduction and clustering into a visualization system, discussing the challenges inherent in developing a visualization system that makes use of both families of algorithms.},

Despite these advantages, convex clustering has not been widely adopted, due to its computationally intensive nature and its lack of compelling visualizations. To address these impediments, we introduce Algorithmic Regularization, an innovative technique for obtaining high-quality estimates of regularization paths using an iterative one-step approximation scheme. We justify our approach with a novel theoretical result, guaranteeing global convergence of the approximate path to the exact solution under easily-checked non-data-dependent assumptions. The application of algorithmic regularization to convex clustering yields the Convex Clustering via Algorithmic Regularization Paths (CARP) algorithm for computing the clustering solution path. On example data sets from genomics and text analysis, CARP delivers over a 100-fold speed-up over existing methods, while attaining a finer approximation grid than standard methods. Furthermore, CARP enables improved visualization of clustering solutions: the fine solution grid returned by CARP can be used to construct a convex clustering-based dendrogram, as well as forming the basis of a dynamic path-wise visualization based on modern web technologies. Our methods are implemented in the open-source R package clustRviz, available at this https URL.},

One of the drawbacks is that the estimated parameters may be deviated from the actual ones. Therefore, robustness is considered so as to cope with the issue of parameter inaccuracy. In view of this, we propose a clustered scenario-tree approach, which accommodates the parameter inaccuracy problem in the context of a scenario tree. Proposed a new kind of scenario tree, called ? cluster tree ?. It accommodates the parameter inaccuracy in the context of a scenario tree. The idea is illustrated with portfolio selection problems.

In this paper, we propose an interactive interface to explore 2D linear projections with visual patterns on subsets. First, we propose a voting-based algorithm to recommend optimal projection, in which the identified pattern looks the most salient. Specifically, we propose three kinds of point-wise quality metrics of 2D linear projections for outliers, clusterings, and trends, respectively. For each sampled projection, we measure its importance by accumulating the metrics of selected points. The projection with the highest importance is recommended. Second, we design an exploring interface with a scatterplot, a projection trail map, and a control panel. Our interface allows users to explore projections by specifying interested data subsets. At last, we employ three datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three case studies of exploring clusters, outliers, and trends.},

However, most current methods are passive in the sense that the side information is provided beforehand and selected randomly. This may require a large number of constraints, some of which could be redundant, unnecessary, or even detrimental to the clustering results. Thus in order to scale such semi-supervised algorithms to larger problems it is desirable to pursue an active clustering method, i.e., an algorithm that maximizes the effectiveness of the available human labor by only requesting human input where it will have the greatest impact. Here, we propose a novel online framework for active semi-supervised spectral clustering that selects pairwise constraints as clustering proceeds, based on the principle of uncertainty reduction. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we decompose the expected uncertainty reduction problem into a gradient and a step-scale, computed via an application of matrix perturbation theory and cluster-assignment entropy, respectively. The resulting model is used to estimate the uncertainty reduction potential of each sample in the dataset. We then present the human user with pairwise queries with respect to only the best candidate sample. We evaluate our method using three different image datasets (faces, leaves and dogs), a set of common UCI machine learning datasets and a gene dataset. The results validate our decomposition formulation and show that our method is consistently superior to existing state-of-the-art techniques, as well as being robust to noise and to unknown numbers of clusters.},

The existing classification schemes, however, have been constructed and maintained manually by domain experts, which require exhaustive time and human effort while vulnerable to subjectivity. Hence, the existing classification systems do not properly reflect the fast-changing trends of the firms and the capital market. As a remedy to such shortcomings, this paper proposes a new classification scheme, Business Text Industry Classification (BTIC), namely, that automatically clusters securities based on the textual information from the corporate disclosures. BTIC exploits the business section of the Form 10-Ks, in which firms provide their self-identities in a rich context. We employ doc2vec for document embedding and apply Ward's hierarchical clustering method to categorize securities into BTIC groups. Evaluation results using 12 financial ratios commonly found in financial research show that BTIC performs just as good as SIC and GICS in terms of inter- and intra-industry homogeneity, especially for the higher level of clustering. Given that, we claim that BTIC outperforms SIC and GICS in four aspects: process automation, objectivity, clustering flexibility, and result interpretability.},

We propose a direct measure of volatility clustering based on the conditional probability distribution (CPD) of the returns given the return in the previous time interval. We found that the CPDs of returns in real financial time series exhibits universal scaling, characterized by a collapse of the CPDs (of different time lags and of different returns in the previous interval) into to a universal curve exhibiting a power-law tail with an exponent of 4. We construct a simple phenomenological model to explain the emergence of VC and the associated volatility scaling. We also study agent-based models of financial markets, and explore the impact of dynamical risk aversion (DRA) of heterogeneous agents on the price fluctuations. We found that the DRA is the primary driving force responsible for excess price fluctuations and the associated volatility clustering. Both our models (phenomenological model and agent-based model) are able to generate time series that reproduces stylized facts of the market data on different time scales. We have also studied general herding behavior often exhibited in financial markets in the context of an evolutionary Minority Game. We discovered a general mechanism for the transition from segregation into opposing groups to clustering towards cautious behavior.},

In this work, we propose a non-parametric bootstrapping approach to estimating the stability of a clustering method, which also captures stability of the individual clusters and observations. This flexible framework enables different types of comparisons between clusterings and can be used in connection with two possible bootstrap approaches for stability. The first approach, scheme 1, can be used to assess confidence (stability) around clustering from the original dataset based on bootstrap replications. A second approach, scheme 2, searches over the bootstrap clusterings for an optimally stable partitioning of the data. The two schemes accommodate different model assumptions that can be motivated by an investigator trust (or lack thereof) in the original data and additional computational considerations. We propose a hierarchical visualization extrapolated from the stability profiles that give insights into the separation of groups, and projected visualizations for the inspection of the stability of individual operations. Our approaches show good performance in simulation and on real data. These approaches can be implemented using the R package bootcluster that is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).},

The minimum spanning tree (MST), the tree connecting all nodes with minimum total weight, is regarded as an important transport backbone of the original weighted graph. We hypothesize that the clustering of the MST reveals insight in the hierarchical structure of weighted graphs. However, existing theories and algorithms have difficulties to define and identify clusters in trees. Here, we first define clustering in trees and then propose a tree agglomerative hierarchical clustering (TAHC) method for the detection of clusters in MSTs. We then demonstrate that the TAHC method can detect clusters in artificial trees, and also in MSTs of weighted social networks, for which the clusters are in agreement with the previously reported clusters of the original weighted networks. Our results therefore not only indicate that clusters can be found in MSTs, but also that the MSTs contain information about the underlying clusters of the original weighted network.},

A choice of KK that correctly characterizes the features of the data is essential for building meaningful clusters. In this paper we tackle the problem of estimating the number of clusters in functional data analysis by introducing a new measure that can be used with different procedures in selecting the optimal KK. The main idea is to use a combination of two test statistics, which measure the lack of parallelism and the mean distance between curves, to compute criteria such as the within and between cluster sum of squares. Simulations in challenging scenarios suggest that procedures using this measure can detect the correct number of clusters more frequently than existing methods in the literature. The application of the proposed method is illustrated on several real datasets.},

This paper presents a comprehensive data mining process to forecast the daily direction of the S\&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) return based on 60 financial and economical features. The fuzzy c-means method (FCM) is initially used to cluster the preprocessed data. A principal component analysis (PCA) is applied next to the entire data set and each of seven clusters. The dimension of the entire cleaned data set is then reduced according to the combining results from the entire data set and each cluster. Corresponding to different levels of the dimensionality reduction, twelve new data sets are generated from the entire cleaned data. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and logistic regression models are then used with the twelve transformed data sets for classification in order to forecast the daily direction of future market returns and indicate the efficiency of dimensionality reduction with PCA. A group of hypothesis tests are performed over the classification and simulation results to show that the ANNs give significantly higher classification accuracy than logistic regression, and that the trading strategies guided by the comprehensive cluster and classification mining procedure based on PCA and ANNs gain higher risk-adjusted profits than the comparison benchmarks, as well as those strategies guided by the forecasts based on PCA and logistic regression models.},

Discrete latent variables model the cluster label while the continuous ones model variations within each cluster. The learning of the model proceeds in a unified probabilistic framework and incorporates the unsupervised clustering as an inner step without the need for an extra inference model as in existing variational-based models. The latent variables learned serve as both observed data embedding or latent representation for data distribution. Our experiments show that the proposed model can achieve competitive unsupervised clustering accuracy and can learn disentangled latent representations to generate realistic samples. In addition, the model can be naturally extended to per-pixel unsupervised clustering which remains largely unexplored.},

A formal approach for addressing this challenge relies on the identification of succinct, user-friendly properties that capture formal differences amongst clustering techniques. While helpful for gaining insight into the nature of clustering paradigms, there is a theory-practice gap that has so far limited the utility of this approach: Formal properties typically highlight advantages of classical linkage-based algorithms, while practical experience shows that center-based methods are preferable for many applications. We present simple new properties that delineate core differences between common clustering paradigms and overcome this theory-practice gap. The properties we present give a formal understanding of the advantages of center-based approaches for some applications and insight into when different clustering paradigms should be used. These properties address how sensitive algorithms are to changes in element frequencies, which we capture in a generalized setting where every element is associated with a real-valued weight. To complement extensive formal analysis, we discuss how these properties can be applied in practice.},

In this paper, we show that this network-based information statistically significantly predicts future asset returns. Because industry professionals are more interested in the economic value-added of competing forecasting approaches, we also devote our attention to an economic analysis. Considering economic performance metrics, network-based predictors generate a clear value-added, which also applies to the multi-asset allocation case.},

Using hierarchical clustering, we propose an alternative cluster-based portfolio to obtain a sequence of cluster assets. On the basis of Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, the estimation risk of the data set becomes the sum of the estimations of the clusters in the sequence. The performance of our method and its competitors is compared empirically and via some simulations in high dimension.},

In practice, one produces several partitions, and a final one is chosen based on validation or selection criteria. There exist an abundance of validation methods that, implicitly or explicitly, assume a certain clustering notion. Moreover, they are often restricted to operate on partitions obtained from a specific method. In this paper, we focus on groups that can be well separated by quadratic or linear boundaries. The reference cluster concept is defined through the quadratic discriminant score function and parameters describing clusters' size, center and scatter. We develop two cluster-quality criteria called quadratic scores. We show that these criteria are consistent with groups generated from a general class of elliptically-symmetric distributions. The quest for this type of groups is common in applications. The connection with likelihood theory for mixture models and model-based clustering is investigated. Based on bootstrap resampling of the quadratic scores, we propose a selection rule that allows choosing among many clustering solutions. The proposed method has the distinctive advantage that it can compare partitions that cannot be compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Extensive numerical experiments and the analysis of real data show that, even if some competing methods turn out to be superior in some setups, the proposed methodology achieves a better overall performance.},

Such a graph-theoretic portfolio partitioning technique is shown to allow the investor to devise robust and tractable asset allocation schemes, by virtue of a rigorous graph framework for considering smaller, computationally feasible, and economically meaningful clusters of assets, based on graph cuts. In turn, this makes it possible to fully utilize the asset returns covariance matrix for constructing the portfolio, even without the requirement for its inversion.

As a result, novel methods ranging from asset network estimation to hierarchical asset selection and portfolio allocation are now part of practitioners' toolboxes. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental problem of learning undirected graphical models under Laplacian structural constraints from the point of view of financial market times series data. In particular, we present natural justifications, supported by empirical evidence, for the usage of the Laplacian matrix as a model for the precision matrix of financial assets, while also establishing a direct link that reveals how Laplacian constraints are coupled to meaningful physical interpretations related to the market index factor and to conditional correlations between stocks. Those interpretations lead to a set of guidelines that practitioners should be aware of when estimating graphs in financial markets. In addition, we design numerical algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers to learn undirected, weighted graphs that take into account stylized facts that are intrinsic to financial data such as heavy tails and modularity. We illustrate how to leverage the learned graphs into practical scenarios such as stock time series clustering and foreign exchange network estimation. The proposed graph learning algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods in an extensive set of practical experiments. Furthermore, we obtain theoretical and empirical convergence results for the proposed algorithms. Along with the developed methodologies for graph learning in financial markets, we release an R package, called fingraph, accommodating the code and data to obtain all the experimental results.},

  abstract         = {Over the past years, many approaches to perform asset allocation have been proposed in the literature. Most of them tackle this problem as an optimization task, where the goal is to maximize return, whilst minimizing the risk. However, such approaches require the inversion of a positive-definite covariance matrix, usually resulting in the concentration of allocation, instability and low performance. Some methods have been recently introduced to solve this problem by facing it as a clustering problem. This paper introduces a framework for asset allocation based on partitional clustering algorithms. The idea is to segment the assets into clusters of correlated assets, allocate resources for each cluster and then within each cluster. The framework allows the use of different partitional clustering algorithms, intragroup and intergroup allocation methods. Also, various assessment criteria are considered, and a specialized initialization method is proposed for the clustering algorithm. The framework is evaluated with the Brazilian Stock Exchange (B3) data from the period 12/2005 to 04/2020. Different initialization methods are used for the clustering algorithm together with two intergroup and two intragroup techniques, resulting in five experimental scenarios. The results are compared with the Ibovespa index, the mean-variance model of Markowitz, and the risk-parity model recently proposed by Lopez de Prado.},

We show that our feature-based approach outperforms the compared indexes for optimal model selection: they are more efficient from low- to high-dimensional range as well as they are more robust to noise. To show the efficiency of our indexes on a real-life application, we consider the task of diachronic analysis on a textual dataset. We demonstrate that our approach allows to get some interesting and relevant results in that context, while other approaches mostly lead to unusable results.},

This entails very often in estimations of correlation matrices so complex it cannot be fully analyzed. Hierarchical clustering reduces the complexity, by only focusing on the correlations that matters.

\leavevmode\newline 

Hierarchical clustering uses graph theory, linked to unsupervised machine learning techniques. Hierarchical clustering is obtained by the suggested data and is a formation of a recursive clustering. Several hierarchical clustering methods are presented and evaluated against traditional riskbased portfolios with focus on left hand tail risk. A regime shift, based on momentum is applied to minimize drawdowns. The portfolios are tested on simulated data derived from Bootstrapping simulations and on historical data in a Walk forward optimization process.

The results indicate that hierarchical clustering based portfolios are truly diversified and achieve statistically better riskadjusted performances than commonly used portfolio optimization techniques.},

  abstract         = {There is nothing like a market crash to focus the mind on the importance of risk management and, more specifically, tail risk management. Because tail events are generally systemic in nature and are characterised by elevated correlations and liquidity squeezes, effective tail risk management is not just a diversification exercise but rather requires explicit and specialised strategies. The natural question that arises then is how do you create an optimal tail risk management strategy? Most studies identify four categories of tail risk management strategy: option-based hedging, asset allocation, dynamic trading and defensive equity. Within each category, we then find a number of strategies available to investors for managing tail risk. Unfortunately, it remains an open question as to which strategy works best for a given investment scenario, or if there even exists a universally optimal strategy to begin with. We attempt to answer this question by analysing a range of commonly used tail risk management strategies in a South African market setting. However, given the breadth of the four available strategy categories, we split our research on this topic into two parts. In this Part I, we firstly examine and quantify the tail risk inherent in South African markets. This is done through a review the long-term history of equity and bond market drawdowns. Thereafter, we discuss nine core principles that are applicable to all candidate strategies and that define good tail risk management. Finally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of option-based tail hedging strategies. The concepts of defensive, offensive, active and indirect tail hedging are discussed at length and examples of each are implemented on historical market data.},

However, achieving true diversification is easier said than done, especially when we do not fully know what we mean when we are talking about diversification. While the qualitative purpose of diversification is well known, a satisfactory quantitative definition of portfolio diversification remains elusive. In this research, we summarise a wide range of diversification measures, focusing our efforts on those most commonly used in practice. We categorise each measure based on which portfolio aspect it focuses on: cardinality, weights, returns, risk or higher moments. We then apply these measures to a range of South African equity indices, thus giving a diagnostic review of historical local equity diversification and, perhaps more importantly, providing a description of the investable opportunity set available tofund managers in this space. Finally, we introduce the idea of diversification profiles. These regime dependent profiles give a much richer description of portfolio diversification than their single-value counterparts and also allow one to manage diversification proactively based on one's view of future market conditions.},

The proposed method differs from ordinary cross-validation, because clustering is fundamentally an unsupervised learning problem. Simulation and real data analysis results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods, especially in high-dimensional settings with heterogeneous or heavy-tailed noise. In a yeast cell cycle dataset, the proposed method finds a parsimonious clustering with interpretable gene groupings. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

This may lead to a mismatch between investors' expected and actual risk. The aim of this paper is to overcome this issue, taking into account not only investors' risk preference but also their attitude towards interconnectdness. To achieve this aim, we combine random matrix theory with correlation networks and extend the Markowitz' optimisation problem to a third dimension. To demonstrate the practical advantage of our proposed approach we employ daily returns of a large set of Exchange Traded Funds, which are representative of the financial products employed by robot-advisors.},

  abstract         = {To evaluate clustering results is a significant part of cluster analysis. Since there are no true class labels for clustering in typical unsupervised learning, many internal cluster validity indices (CVIs), which use predicted labels and data, have been created. Without true labels, to design an effective CVI is as difficult as to create a clustering method. And it is crucial to have more CVIs because there are no universal CVIs that can be used to measure all datasets and no specific methods of selecting a proper CVI for clusters without true labels. Therefore, to apply a variety of CVIs to evaluate clustering results is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel internal CVI -- the Distance-based Separability Index (DSI), based on a data separability measure. We compared the DSI with eight internal CVIs including studies from early Dunn (1974) to most recent CVDD (2019) and an external CVI as ground truth, by using clustering results of five clustering algorithms on 12 real and 97 synthetic datasets. Results show DSI is an effective, unique, and competitive CVI to other compared CVIs. We also summarized the general process to evaluate CVIs and created the rank-difference metric for comparison of CVIs' results.},

Collectivity, defined as coherent motion of the whole system or of some of its parts, manifests itself in the time-dependent structures of covariance and correlation matrices. The largest eigenvalue corresponds to the collective motion of the system as a whole, while the other large, isolated, eigenvalues indicate collectivity in parts of the system. In the case of finance, these are industrial sectors. By removing the collective motion of the system as a whole, the latter effects are much better revealed. We measure a remaining collectivity to which we refer as average sector collectivity. We identify collective signals around the Lehman Brothers crash and after the dot-com bubble burst. For the Lehman Brothers crash, we find a potential precursor. We analyze 213 US stocks over a period of more than 30 years from 1990 to 2021. We plot the average sector collectivity versus the collectivity corresponding to the largest eigenvalue to study the whole market trajectory in a two dimensional space spanned by both collectivities. Therefore, we capture the average sector collectivity in a much more precise way. Additionally, we observe that larger values in the average sector collectivity are often accompanied by trend shifts in the mean covariances and mean correlations. As of 2015/2016 the collectivity in the US stock markets changed fundamentally.},

To achieve the results, we set up a portfolio optimization problem building two networks of pension funds: one based on the (Pearson) correlation, and the other measuring the tail correlation. For each network, we use the local clustering coefficients to describe the level of connectivity, and we insert it in the risk function. This approach allows us to consider the network measures directly in the portfolio optimization model. We compare the results with the classical Markowitz setting, and we find a new efficient frontier overperforming the Markowitz one. A comparison among the performances of pension funds and their declared portfolio of benchmarks is also reported.},

We derive its asymptotic properties under three scenarios depending on to what extent the common factors are asymptotically dominant. With panel data consisting of N cross sectional time series of length T, the asymptotic results hold under the mild assumption that min(T,N) goes to infinity, with an otherwise arbitrary relationship between N and T, allowing the results to apply to most panel data examples. Bootstrap procedures are proposed to approximate the sampling distribution of the test statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation study showed that our test outperforms several other existing tests in finite samples in a number of cases, particularly when N is much larger than T. The practical application of the proposed results are demonstrated with real data applications to detecting and estimating change points in the high dimensional FRED-MD macroeconomic data set.},

To address this limitation, we propose a compositional architecture, ACES, which certifiably decides on a per-sample basis whether to use a smoothed model yielding predictions with guarantees or a more accurate standard model without guarantees. This, in contrast to prior approaches, enables both high standard accuracies and significant provable robustness.

Following former researches, the epidemic model has been usually used to detect dynamic characteristics in a stock price complex systems. Recently, multilayer networks have been demonstrated well when working on heterogeneous nodes rather than integrated networks. In this paper, we proposed a two-layer SIR propagation model with an infective medium to analyze the spread of financial shocks. In consideration of strict financial regulation in the A shares, the model assumed that capital cannot flow directly between layers but through the Hong Kong stock market. By applying the model to constituent stocks included in three prominent indices, Standard \& Poor 500, Shanghai and Shenzhen 300, and Hang Seng(medium), we established a two-layer Granger networks. Betweenness showed that the Hong Kong stock market had a promoting transition function of financial shocks between the US stock markets and the mainland China stock markets. In addition, with a big basic reproduction number, stock markets system appeared to be vulnerable during extreme financial shock such as the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic and the meltdown of stock markets. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and the spreading simulation indicated that the US stock markets were much more robust to financial shocks than the mainland China stock markets.},

  abstract         = {In this article, the authors present a conceptual framework named Adaptive Seriational Risk Parity (ASRP) to extend Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) as an asset allocation heuristic. The first step of HRP (quasi-diagonalization) determining the hierarchy of assets is required for the actual allocation in the second step of HRP (recursive bisectioning). In the original HRP scheme, this hierarchy is found using the single-linkage hierarchical clustering of the correlation matrix, which is a static tree-based method. The authors of this paper compare the performance of the standard HRP with other static and also adaptive tree-based methods, but also seriation-based methods that do not rely on trees. Seriation is a broader concept allowing to reorder the rows or columns of a matrix to best express similarities between the elements. Each discussed variation leads to a different time series reflecting portfolio performance using a 20-year backtest of a multi-asset futures universe. An unsupervised representation learning based on this time series data creates a taxonomy that groups the strategies in high correspondence to the structure of the various types of ASRP. The performance analysis of the variations shows that most of the static tree-based alternatives of HRP outperform the single linkage clustering used in HRP on a risk-adjusted basis. Adaptive tree methods show mixed results and most generic seriation-based approaches underperform.},

In such a setting, being unable to assign reliable point estimates to the probabilities (or frequencies) of the states creates the ambiguity. We first describe how this ambiguity can be modeled probabilistically. Then, we show how this added uncertainty can be dealt with in optimal asset allocation problems. In simple-yet-realistic example applications we demonstrate that without sacrificing much of the upside, ambiguity managed portfolios may enhance the uniformity of returns across different states when compared to portfolios constructed by traditional methods. We stress that a key conclusion to be taken from these methods builds the case for insurance-like and potentially negative-yielding investments such as bonds and commodities so as to hedge the unforeseeable macrouncertainties for a smoother portfolio performance. Finally, we offer a variety of problem domains in which ambiguity management can be nested including macroeconomic scenario-based asset allocation, investing with regime-switching models, momentum investing, and risk-based investing.},

  abstract         = {Investors typically measure an asset’s potential to diversify a portfolio by its correlations with the portfolio’s other assets, but correlation is useful only if it provides a good estimate of how an asset’s returns co-occur cumulatively with the other asset returns over the investor’s prospective horizon. And because correlation is an average of sub-period co-occurrences, it only serves as a good estimate of prospective co-occurrence if the assets’ returns are multi-variate normal, which requires them to be independent and identically distributed. The authors provide evidence that correlations differ depending on the return interval used to estimate them, which indicates they are not serially independent. Moreover, the authors show that asset co-movement differs between regimes of high and low interest rates and between turbulent and quiescent markets, and that they are asymmetric around return thresholds, which indicates that returns are not identically distributed. These departures from multi-variate normality cast serious doubt on the usefulness of full-sample correlations to measure an asset’s potential to diversify a portfolio. The authors propose an alternative technique for diversifying a portfolio that explicitly considers the empirical prevalence of co-occurrences and thus the non-normality of returns.},

  abstract         = {That investors should diversify their portfolios is a core principle of modern finance. Yet there are some periods where diversification is undesirable. When the portfolio's main growth engine performs well, investors prefer the opposite of diversification. An ideal complement to the growth engine would provide diversification when it performs poorly and unification when it performs well. Numerous studies have presented evidence of asymmetric correlations between assets. Unfortunately, this asymmetry is often of the undesirable variety: it is characterized by downside unification and upside diversification. In other words, diversification often disappears when it is most needed. In this article we highlight a fundamental flaw in the way that some prior studies have measured correlation asymmetry. Because they estimate downside correlations from subsamples where both assets perform poorly, they ignore instances of "successful" diversification; that is, periods where one asset's gains offset the other's losses.

  abstract         = {That investors should diversify their portfolios is a core principle of modern finance. Yet there are some periods where diversification is undesirable. When the portfolio's main growth engine performs well, investors prefer the opposite of diversification. An ideal complement to the growth engine would provide diversification when it performs poorly and unification when it performs well. Numerous studies have presented evidence of asymmetric correlations between assets. Unfortunately, this asymmetry is often of the undesirable variety: it is characterized by downside unification and upside diversification. In other words, diversification often disappears when it is most needed. In this article we highlight a fundamental flaw in the way that some prior studies have measured correlation asymmetry. Because they estimate downside correlations from subsamples where both assets perform poorly, they ignore instances of "successful" diversification; that is, periods where one asset's gains offset the other's losses. We propose instead that investors measure what matters: the degree to which a given asset diversifies the main growth engine when it underperforms. This approach yields starkly different conclusions, particularly for asset pairs with low full sample correlation.

Although it is widely acknowledged that these measures are not necessarily stationary across samples, most analysts assume implicitly that, within sample, volatilities scale with the square root of time and correlations estimated from high-frequency returns are similar to correlations estimated from low-frequency returns.

Evidence does not support this view. Instead, evidence shows that relative asset values often evolve through time in ways that are highly inconsistent with their high-frequency volatilities and correlations. As a consequence, portfolios that are optimal based on high-frequency returns often lead to significantly suboptimal results for investors with long horizons. The causes and consequences of this discrepancy are analyzed by the article's authors, as well as presenting a framework for constructing portfolios that balance short-horizon and long-horizon optimality.},

However, investors typically overlook the potential for correlation patterns to help predict subsequent return and risk. Kritzman and Li (2010) introduced what is perhaps the first measure to capture the degree of multivariate asset price 'unusualness' through time. Their financial turbulence score spikes when asset prices 'behave in an uncharacteristic fashion, including extreme price moves, decoupling of correlated assets, and convergence of uncorrelated assets.'

We extend Kritzman and Li's study by disentangling the volatility and correlation components of turbulence to derive a measure of correlation surprise. We show how correlation surprise is orthogonal to volatility and present empirical evidence that it contains incremental forward-looking information. On average, after controlling for volatility, we find that periods characterized by correlation surprise lead to higher risk and lower returns to risk premia than periods characterized by typical correlations. This result holds across many markets including US equities, European equities and foreign exchange.

Our results corroborate the predictive capacity of turbulence and suggest that its decomposition may also prove fruitful in forecasting investment performance.},

If we assume that manager specific alpha is fully diluted across a broad universe of private equity managers, we can interpret the balance of excess return as a premium for illiquidity.

This result suggests that investors can capture the asset class alpha of private equity by using liquid assets such as ETFs to match the sector weights of private equity investors.

The great volatility and low returns involved in European equity markets are a possible explanation for why investors prefer bonds that show Sharpe ratios higher than one. Taking into account five-year realized inflation, as well as strong bond market performance in the past 20 years with yields in the negative territory, the evidence indicates that the window for expected returns on balanced portfolios with large bond exposure is firmly shut.

It can be viewed as an extension or a modification of the algorithm using the neural additive model. The method is based on using an ensemble of gradient boosting machines (GBMs) such that each GBM is learned on a single feature and produces a shape function of the feature. The ensemble is composed as a weighted sum of separate GBMs resulting a weighted sum of shape functions which form the generalized additive model. GBMs are built in parallel using randomized decision trees of depth 1, which provide a very simple architecture. Weights of GBMs as well as features are computed in each iteration of boosting by using the Lasso method and then updated by means of a specific smoothing procedure. In contrast to the neural additive model, the method provides weights of features in the explicit form, and it is simply trained. A lot of numerical experiments with an algorithm implementing the proposed method on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate its efficiency and properties for local and global interpretation.},

  abstract         = {A new method for local and global explanation of the machine learning black-box model predictions by tabular data is proposed. It is implemented as a system called AFEX (Attention-like Feature EXplanation) and consisting of two main parts. The first part is a set of the one-feature neural subnetworks which aim to get a specific representation for every feature in the form of a basis of shape functions. The subnetworks use shortcut connections with trainable parameters to improve the network performance. The second part of AFEX produces shape functions of features as the weighted sum of the basis shape functions where weights are computed by using an attention-like mechanism. AFEX identifies pairwise interactions between features based on pairwise multiplications of shape functions corresponding to different features. A modification of AFEX with incorporating an additional surrogate model which approximates the black-box model is proposed. AFEX is trained end-to-end on a whole dataset only once such that it does not require to train neural networks again in the explanation stage. Numerical experiments with synthetic and real data illustrate AFEX.},

Using the Fama-French and currency factors, the authors analyze the bond benchmarks and find that currency carry strategies can easily be modified to suit bond investors, portfolio managers, and allocators. A central finding of the authors is that currency carry strategies help to mitigate the currency risk of the US dollar. Specifically, broad indices (including credit and government exposure) deserve modified carry strategies to mitigate the impact on the US dollar The results show that the exposure to the equity-based profitability factor, one of the factors in the Fama-French five-factor model, is to some extent a natural hedge against the US-dollar risk of high-yield and corporate indices. Moreover, combined currency carry overlay strategies and fixed-income investments generate Probabilistic Sharpe ratios above a certain threshold level. The results suggest that investors should consider modified currency carry strategies rather than simple carry rules when managing both US and global-high yield, corporate, and government debt. The authors also provide a framework that can be used to diversify the impact of individual equity-based factors and the currency style factors on fixed-income benchmarks.},

Analysis of the interconnectedness between assets and factors shows that their relationship is strong. The authors compare the allocation techniques, considering centrality and hierarchal-based networks. They demonstrate the advantages of graph theory to explain the advantages to portfolio management and the dynamic nature of assets and factors with their importance score. They find that asset allocation can be efficiently derived using directed networks, dynamically driven by both US Treasuries and currency returns with significant centrality scores. Alternatively, the inverse variance weight estimation and correlation-based networks generate factor allocation with favorable risk-return parameters. Furthermore, factor allocation is driven mostly by the importance scores of the Fama-French-Carhart factors: SMB, HML, CMA, RMW, and MOM. The authors confirm previous results and argue that both factors and assets are interconnected with different value and momentum factors. Therefore, a blended strategy comprising factors and assets can be defensible for investors. As argued in previous research, factors are much more overcrowded than assets. Therefore, the centrality scores help to identify the crowded exposure and build diversified allocation. The authors run LASSO regressions and show how the network-based allocation can be implemented using machine learning.},

Specifically, the authors show how data-driven research can model decisions to place orders and to generate prices by matching orders accordingly. The other issue is price interconnectedness at markets by networks. The authors show that interactions shape a market  performance. Emergence comprises the interactions at markets; as such, the collective may not be equal to the sum of individual activities. As a consequence, the assumption that markets are in equilibrium and that arbitrage opportunities do not exist can be replaced by more realistic working hypotheses. The authors show with the two examples that market participants interact, learn, and trade. These individual interactions can be described as organized complexity. Whereas calculus may not support explicit modeling of interactions, the age of big data permits their modeling and application of innovative concepts, such as network solutions for asset allocation, which can be modeled using machine learning.

These four diversification principles are the DNA of the existing portfolio selection rules and asset pricing theories and are instrumental to the understanding of diversification in portfolio theory.

  abstract         = {This thesis aims to answer how many stocks make a diversified portfolio in a continuous-time world. The study investigates what are the factors determining diversification effects in a real, continuous-time, world as opposed to thoroughly studied theoretical single period world. Continuous-time world investors care about geometric, instead of arithmetic, rate of return.

\leavevmode\newline 

We show how methodology based on information theory can be utilized in investing context. Geometric risk premium is explained by the Shannon limit and its derivative, fractional Kelly criterion. Investing world counterpart for the Shannon limit, compounding process capacity, is derived. Geometric risk premium is decomposed to single stock risk premium and diversification premium. Method for estimating diversification premium is provided. Concept of realizable risk premium is derived and used in risk averse investor diversification metrics. Diversification effect is measured as a (realizable) risk premium ratio and as a (realizable) gross compound excess wealth ratio. Both ratios are between a randomly selected portfolio of selected size and fully diversified benchmark.

\leavevmode\newline 

We show, both analytically and empirically, that diversification in a continuous-time world is a negative price lunch as opposed to free lunch in a single period world. Investor is paid a diversification premium, implying higher geometric risk premium, for consuming a lunch. The magnitude of diversification premium difference to benchmark, the opportunity cost of foregone diversification, is shown to be equal to one half of portfolio's idiosyncratic variance scaled by squared investment fraction. To maintain a constant wealth ratio, required level of diversification for a long-term risk neutral investor is approximately directly proportional to investment time horizon length.

\leavevmode\newline 

The factors determining required level of diversification in a continuous-time world are number of stocks in the benchmark, Sharpe ratio and variance of the benchmark, idiosyncratic variance of an average stock, investment fraction and time. At investment fraction 1.0, risk averse investor requires more than 100, 200 or 1000 stocks to achieve 90\%, 95\% or 99\% of the maximum diversification benefit, respectively. For short-term risk neutral investor, the corresponding numbers are about 20, 40 or 200 stocks and yet significantly more for long-term risk neutral investor. The numbers increase and decrease as investment fraction increase and decrease, respectively. We find that small firms require substantially more diversification compared to large firms and that there are substantial and consistent differences in diversification premiums between investing styles.},

It is reasonable to infer from the classic Anscombe quartet that relying on descriptive statistics, and specifically, correlation, to achieve portfolio diversification may not derive the most optimal multiperiod portfolio risk-adjusted return because stocks in a portfolio can exhibit different price trends over time, even with the same computed pairwise correlation. This research applied a shape-based time-series clustering technique of agglomerative hierarchical clustering using dynamic time-series warping as a distance measure to aggregate stocks into like-trending clusters across time as a portfolio diversification tool. Results support the use of the shape-based clustering technique for (1) portfolio allocation and rebalancing, (2) dynamic predictive portfolio construction, and (3) individual stock selection through outlier identification. The findings will be a useful addition to the existing literature in portfolio management by providing shape-based clustering as an alternative tool for portfolio construction and security selection.},

I differentiate between type-A and type-B spurious claims, and explain how both types prevent factor investing from advancing beyond its current pre-scientific stage. This seminar analyzes the current state of causal confusion in the factor investing literature, and proposes solutions with the potential to transform factor investing into a truly scientific discipline.

  abstract         = {Correlation matrices are ubiquitous in finance. Some key applications include portfolio construction, risk management, and factor/style analysis. Correlation matrices are usually estimated from historical empirical observations or derived from historically estimated factors. It is widely acknowledged that empirical correlation matrices: (a) have poor numerical properties that lead to unreliable estimators; and (b) have poor predictive power. Additionally, factor-based correlation matrices have their own caveats. In particular, estimated factors are typically non-hierarchical and do not allow for interactions at different levels. This contravenes the fact that financial instruments typically exhibit a nested cluster structure (e.g., MSCI GICS levels 1-4).This paper introduces a machine learning (ML) algorithm to estimate forward-looking correlation matrices implied by economic theory. Given a particular theoretical representation of the hierarchical structure that governs a universe of securities, the method fits the correlation matrix that complies with that theoretical representation of the future. This particular use case demonstrates how, contrary to popular perception, ML solutions are not black-boxes, and can be applied effectively to develop and test economic theories.},

A fund?s track record provides a sort of genetic marker, which we can use to identify mutations. This has motivated our use of a biometric procedure to detect the emergence of a new investment style within a fund?s track record. In doing so, we answer the question: What is the probability that a particular PM?s performance is departing from the reference distribution used to allocate her capital? The EF3M algorithm, inspired by evolutionary biology, may help detect early stages of an evolutionary divergence in an investment style and trigger a decision to review a fund?s capital allocation.},

Beyond merely pointing to this industrywide problem, we offer a practical solution. We hope that the machine learning tools presented in this paper will help financial academic journals filter out false positives, and bring up the retraction rate to reasonable levels.

They show that KCA presents several advantages over such popular noise-reduction methods as fast Fourier transform (FFT) or locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS). First, KCA provides band estimates in addition to point estimates. Second, KCA further decomposes the signal in terms of three hidden components, which can be intuitively associated with position, velocity, and acceleration. Third, KCA is more robust in forecasting applications. Fourth, KCA is a forward-looking, state-space approach, resilient to structural changes. The authors believe that this type of decomposition is particularly useful in the analysis of trend following, momentum, and mean reversion in financial prices. An instrument exhibits financial inertia when its price acceleration is not significantly greater than zero for long periods of time. This empirical analysis of 19 of the most liquid futures worldwide confirms the presence of strong inertia across all asset classes. The authors also argue that KCA can be useful to market makers, liquidity providers, and faders for the calculation of their trading ranges.},

After reviewing some well-known hedging algorithms, two new procedures are introduced, called Dickey-Fuller Optimal (DFO), Mini-Max Subset Correlation (MMSC). The former is a multi-period, cointegration-based hedging method that estimates the holdings that are most likely to deliver a hedging error absent of unit root. The latter is a single-period method that studies the geometry of the hedging errors and estimates a hedging vector such that subsets of its components are as orthogonal as possible to the error.

We test each method for stability and robustness of the derived hedged portfolio. Results indicate that DFO produces estimates similar to the Error Correction Method, but more stable. Likewise, MMSC estimates are similar to Principal Component Analysis but more stable. Finally, a generalized Box-Tiao Canonical Decomposition (BTCD) method is proposed, which is of the multi-period class. BTCD estimates are also very stable, and cannot be related to any of the aforementioned methodologies.

Finally, we find that all three advanced hedging methods (MMSC, BTCD, DFO) perform well.},

  abstract         = {Selection bias under multiple testing is a serious problem. From a practitioner perspective, failure to disclose the impact of multiple tests of a proposed investment strategy to clients and senior management can lead to the adoption of a false discovery. Clients will lose money, senior management will misallocate resources, and the firm may be exposed to reputational, legal, and regulatory risks. From the perspective of academic journals that publish evidence supporting an investment strategy, the failure to address selection bias under multiple testing threatens to invalidate large portions of the literature in empirical finance. In this article, the authors propose a template that practitioners should use to fairly disclose multiple tests involved in an alleged discovery when pitching strategies to clients and senior management. The same template could be used by contributors to academic journals so that referees, and ultimately readers, can assess the strategy. By disclosing this information, those who are charged with making the final decision about a discovery can evaluate the probability that the purported discovery is false.},

The author explains what data researchers need to report to allow others to evaluate the effect that multiple testing has had on reported performance. He applies his method to a real case of strategy development and estimates the probability that a discovered strategy is false.},

  abstract         = {There are three fundamental ways of testing the validity of an investment algorithm against historical evidence: a) the walk-forward method; b) the resampling method; and c) the Monte Carlo method. By far the most common approach followed among academics and practitioners is the walk-forward method. Implicit in that choice is the assumption that a given investment algorithm should be deployed throughout all market regimes. We denote such assumption the -weather hypothesis, and the algorithms based on that hypothesis investment algorithms (or strategies). The all-weather hypothesis is not necessarily true, as demonstrated by the fact that many investment strategies have floundered in a zero-rate environment. This motivates the problem of identifying investment algorithms that are optimal for specific market regimes, denoted investment algorithms. This paper argues that backtesting against synthetic datasets should be the preferred approach for developing tactical investment algorithms. A new organizational structure for asset managers is proposed, as a tactical algorithmic factory, consistent with the Monte Carlo backtesting paradigm.},

  abstract         = {Convex optimization solutions tend to be unstable, to the point of entirely offsetting the benefits of optimization. For example, in the context of financial applications, it is known that portfolios optimized in-sample often underperform the naive (equal weights) allocation out-of-sample. This instability can be traced back to two sources: (i) noise in the input variables; and (ii) signal structure that magnifies the estimation errors in the input variables. A first innovation of this paper is to introduce the nested clustered optimization algorithm ({NCO}), a method that tackles both sources of instability.Over the past 60 years, various approaches have been developed to address these two sources of instability. These approaches are flawed in the sense that different methods may be appropriate for different input variables, and it is unrealistic to expect that one method will dominate all the rest under all circumstances. Accordingly, a second innovation of this paper is to introduce {MCOS}, a Monte Carlo approach that estimates the allocation error produced by various optimization methods on a particular set of input variables. The result is a precise determination of what method is most robust to a particular case. Thus, rather than relying always on one particular approach, {MCOS} allows users to apply opportunistically whatever optimization method is best suited in a particular setting.Presentation materials are available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3469964.},

Machine learning ({ML}) techniques offer the numerical power and functional flexibility needed to identify complex patterns in a high-dimensional space. However, {ML} is often perceived as a black box, in contrast with the transparency of econometric approaches. This article demonstrates that each analytical step of the econometric process has a homologous step in {ML} analyses.

We propose a new cluster representative method MDR (maximum distance representatives). In our method MDR, we choose the stocks which has maximum distance with other representatives. MDR can construct a more diverse portfolio than center method. The effectiveness of cluster representative selection methods can be evaluated by an index IBEF based on the concept of efficient frontier. Our experiments show that MDR can effectively improve the efficient frontier, which means MDR can bring more profits than center representative method at the same risk level.},

This workshop brought several experts in pure and applied mathematics together with applied researchers from medical imaging, radar signal processing and finance. The authors belong to the latter group. This document was written as a long introduction to further development of geometric tools in financial applications such as risk or portfolio analysis. Indeed, risk and portfolio analysis essentially rely on covariance matrices. Besides that the Gaussian assumption is known to be inaccurate, covariance matrices are difficult to estimate from empirical data. To filter noise from the empirical estimate, Mantegna proposed using hierarchical clustering. In this work, we first show that this procedure is statistically consistent. Then, we propose to use clustering with a much broader application than the filtering of empirical covariance matrices from the estimated correlation coefficients. To be able to do that, we need to obtain distances between the financial time series that incorporate all the available information in these cross-dependent random processes.},

  abstract         = {Modern portfolio theory introduced by Markowitz in 1952 is the most popular portfolio optimization framework established based on the trade-off between risk and return as an operation research model. The main shortcoming of applying Markowitz portfolio optimization in practice is that the obtained optimal weights are really sensitive to the embedded uncertainty in return series of stocks. In this paper, it is demonstrated how using a new methodology of time series clustering as a remedy can lead to a more robust and accurate portfolio in terms of the gap between mean variance efficient frontier obtained from the optimization model and the one observed in reality. In this regard, two similarity measures, the autocorrelation coefficients and the weighted dynamic time warping, are used in an innovative way to construct the desired portfolio optimization model. Moreover, the effectiveness of proposed approach is investigated in two different market conditions: semi-realistic and full-realistic. In the first one, it is assumed that the forecasted and realized stocks mean returns are the same; however, these returns are not necessarily equal in the second market conditions. Finally, a database of stock prices from the literature is utilized to show the robustness and accuracy of the proposed approach in empirical results in comparison with applied similarity measures in previous researches.},

We study both the full correlation networks and those filtered using the PMFG method. We conclude that stocks tend to become more similar in the full correlation networks during times of market disruption for the US and UK markets - implying that nodes that were once dissimilar (and therefore a good choice for a low risk portfolio) are no longer so, demonstrating the difficulties of choosing a diversified portfolio. Furthermore, these full networks are also more stable by certain measures during these periods of disruption, contrary to expectations. However, these apply less to the PMFGs and the German market.},

MSTs constructed using these rank methods tend to be more stable and maintain more edges over the dataset than those constructed using Pearson correlation. The edge agreement between the Pearson and rank MSTs varies significantly depending on the state of the markets, but the rank MSTs generally show strong agreement at all times. Deviation from univariate normality can be related to changes in the correlation matrices but is more difficult to connect to changes in the MSTs. Irrelevant of coefficient, the trees tend to have similar topologies. Portfolios constructed from the MST correlation matrices have a smaller turnover than those from the full covariance matrix for the larger markets, but not for the smaller German market. Using a bootstrap method we find that the correlation matrices constructed using the rank correlations are more robust, but there is little difference between the robustness of the MSTs.},

I demonstrate that the basis between spot and futures contracts predicts future returns across the asset classes. The predictor consistently beats the historical average, producing a median monthly out-of-sample R2, measured over the period between January 1986 and December 2016, of approximately 0.36 a value that is comparable to those of the best equity premium predictors considered in Campbell and Thompson (2008). A simple long-short strategy based on the new predictor delivers an out-of-sample alpha of 2.54.5\% per annum with respect to the asset pricing models considered and produces an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio of almost 0.5, which is particularly striking since the strategy is countercyclical. This performance is robust across sub-periods, market environments, portfolio construction methodologies and transaction costs. A cross-sectional structure analysis reveals that two observable common factors, constructed as equally-weighted indices of the bases of financial assets and commodities, are related to the short-term interest rate and the business cycle, respectively.},

To illustrate this framework, we apply it to investigate momentum in the performance of hedge funds of the managed futures industry.

Our methodology extends the toolbox of performance persistence tests and results in findings that can be implemented by institutional investors.},

The performance is stronger with volatility-based position sizing, robust to implementation considerations such as a one-day gap between signal generation and execution, and persistent across asset classes and subperiods. The authors introduce a shorter duration momentum strategy with a weekly rebalancing frequency, which cannot be replicated using monthly returns. The authors find that the short-term strategy is a strong diversifier to the longer-term strategies, but the benefit may be reduced, or even completely offset, if the quality of trade execution is poor. The authors also find that the positive contribution of short-term momentum is driven by its superior diversifying characteristics rather than by the rebalancing frequency effect.},

We show that the standard definition of eigenvector centrality is misleading when the adjacency matrix in a network can take negative values. This is, for example, the case when the network topology is induced by the correlation matrix between assets in a portfolio. To correct for this, we introduce the concept of positive and negative eigenvector centrality. Our results show that the loss function associated to the minimum variance portfolio is positively/negatively related to the positive and negative eigenvector centrality under short-selling constraints but cannot be generalized beyond that. Furthermore, in contrast to what is claimed in the related literature, this relationship does not imply any monotonic relationship between the centrality of an asset and its optimal portfolio allocation.

The hedging demand on risky assets depends positively on the predictability of the risky asset and the persistence of the predictors, and negatively on the degree of investor's relative risk aversion.

Our model accommodates an arbitrarily large number of assets in the portfolio and state variables in the information set. The empirical results for a portfolio of stocks, bonds and cash provide ample support to the linear specification of the portfolio weights and reveal significant differences between myopic (one-period) and strategic (long-term) optimal portfolio allocations.},

These tests allow for the construction of dynamic trading strategies based on nonparametric density forecasts of hedge fund returns. During the recent financial turmoil, our tests predict a superior performance for the Global Macro investment style compared with the other strategies of 'Directional Traders'. The Dedicated Short Bias investment style is stochastically dominated by the other directional styles. These results are confirmed by simple nonparametric tests constructed from realized excess returns. Further, by utilizing a cross-validation method for optimal bandwidth parameter selection, we discover the factors that have predictive power regarding the density of hedge fund returns. We observe that different factors have forecasting power for different regions of the returns distribution and, more importantly, that the Fung and Hsieh factors have power not only for describing the risk premium but also, if appropriately exploited, for density forecasting. This article predicts the relative performance of directional hedge fund styles. We apply time-varying conditional stochastic dominance tests. Our tests predict a superior performance of the Global Macro style. We also find out which factors have predictive power for the density of returns.},

In institutional asset management of conventional asset classes, target volatility concepts and dynamic allocation heuristics are popular to improve the robustness of portfolio.
Can similar techniques also be used to construct delevered and diversified portfolios of crypto assets? A robust candidate approach for allocation is Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP), as it incorporates a filtered correlation structure and is less sensitive to noise than quadratic optimization, as shown in several studies. Recent publications have extended the concept of HRP in several directions. We compare some of these extensions to determine which variant is most useful for constructing crypto baskets. We find that a particular type of adaptive HRP strategy outperforms other extensions on a risk-adjusted basis, leading us to a deeper investigation of the changing nature of correlation structures between cryptos - both quantitatively and visually. We find that structural breaks in crypto correlations are prevalent and that the best-fitting hierarchical cluster representations change over time, which is only captured by distance matrix-based adaptive HRP approaches.},

In the first chapter, we model the shock propagation mechanism among assets via network theory and provide an approach to construct well-diversified portfolios that are resilient to shock propagation and contagion issues in the volatile and crisis periods. The second chapter analyzes the influence of the hedging network among assets on the portfolio diversification attributes. Building on the hedging network perspective of the market, we propose a network centrality measure to find stocks that are most suitable to form a well-diversified portfolio. The results clearly shows that our diversification strategy performs better than the conventional diversification strategies both in-sample and out-of-sample. In the third chapter, we analyze the market network constructed by adopting assets as nodes and their returns' correlation as links. We theoretically show that there is a negative relationship between the centrality of assets in such a network and the weights assigned to them in the Markowitz prescription. Based on our theoretical findings, we propose a portfolio selection strategy that out-performs well-known benchmarks while presenting positive and significant Carhart alphas.},

Many so-called diversified portfolios performed very badly and faced widespread criticism afterwards. To alleviate the difficulties encountered in the context of the Great Recession, this paper attempts to provide a simple and efficient macroeconomic framework for asset allocation.

To this aim, this paper points out the importance of the growth cycle introduced by Mintz (1974) for euro and dollar-based investors. Moreover, Anas and Ferrara (2004) refine the description of different economic phases by jointly considering the classical business cycle and the growth cycle. This article emphasizes how this economic cyclical framework can improve strategic asset allocation choices and that dynamic macro-based regime-switching asset allocations achieve superior risk adjusted returns than static alternative in the euro area and in the United States.},

To validate this claim, economic cycles are first rigorously defined, namely the classical business cycle and the growth cycle, better known as the output gap. The description of different economic phases is refined by jointly considering both economic cycles. It improves the classical analysis of economic cycles by considering sometimes two distinct phases and sometimes four distinct phases. The theoretical influence of economic cycles on time-varying risk premiums is then explained based on two key economic concepts: nominal GDP and adaptive expectations. Simple dynamic investment strategies confirm the importance of economical cycles, especially the growth cycle, for euro and dollar-based investors. At last, this economic cyclical framework can improve strategic asset allocation choices.},

HERC merges and enhances the machine learning approach of HCAA and the Top-Down recursive bisection of HRP. In more detail, the modified Top-Down recursive division is based on the shape of dendrogram, follows an Equal Risk Contribution allocation and is extended to downside risk measures such as conditional value at risk (CVaR) and Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR). The out-of-sample performances of hierarchical clustering based portfolios are evaluated across two empirical datasets, which differ in terms of number of assets and composition of the universe (multi-assets and individual stocks).

  abstract         = {This article is part of a comprehensive research project on liquidity risk in asset management, which can be divided into three dimensions. The first dimension covers liability liquidity risk (or funding liquidity) modeling, the second dimension focuses on asset liquidity risk (or market liquidity) modeling, and the third dimension considers the asset-liability management of the liquidity gap risk (or asset-liability matching). The purpose of this research is to propose a methodological and practical framework in order to perform liquidity stress testing programs, which comply with regulatory guidelines (ESMA, 2019, 2020) and are useful for fund managers. The review of the academic literature and professional research studies shows that there is a lack of standardized and analytical models. The aim of this research project is then to fill the gap with the goal of developing mathematical and statistical approaches, and providing appropriate answers. In this second article focused on asset liquidity risk modeling, we propose a market impact model to estimate transaction costs. After presenting a toy model that helps to understand the main concepts of asset liquidity, we consider a two-regime model, which is based on the power-law property of price impact. Then, we define several asset liquidity measures such as liquidity cost, liquidation ratio and shortfall or time to liquidation in order to assess the different dimensions of asset liquidity. Finally, we apply this asset liquidity framework to stocks and bonds and discuss the issues of calibrating the transaction cost model.},

  abstract         = {This article studies the impact of carbon risk on stock pricing. To address this, we consider the seminal approach of G\"orgen \textsl{et al.} (2019), who proposed estimating the carbon financial risk of equities by their carbon beta. To achieve this, the primary task is to develop a brown-minus-green (or BMG) risk factor, similar to Fama and French (1992). Secondly, we must estimate the carbon beta using a multi-factor model. While G\"orgen \textsl{et al.} (2019) considered that the carbon beta is constant, we propose a time-varying estimation model to assess the dynamics of the carbon risk. Moreover, we test several specifications of the BMG factor to understand which climate change-related dimensions are priced in by the stock market. In the second part of the article, we focus on the carbon risk management of investment portfolios. First, we analyze how carbon risk impacts the construction of a minimum variance portfolio. As the goal of this portfolio is to reduce unrewarded financial risks of an investment, incorporating the carbon risk into this approach fulfils this objective. Second, we propose a new framework for building enhanced index portfolios with a lower exposure to carbon risk than capitalization-weighted stock indices. Finally, we explore how carbon sensitivities can improve the robustness of factor investing portfolios.},

The purpose of this research is to propose a methodological and practical framework in order to perform liquidity stress testing programs, which comply with regulatory guidelines (ESMA, 2019, 2020) and are useful for fund managers.

The three dimensions have been developed in the published working papers: (1) modeling the liability liquidity risk, (2) modeling the asset liquidity risk and (3) managing the asset-liability liquidity risk. This fourth working paper provides three examples and the comprehensive details to compute the redemption coverage ratio, implement reverse stress testing and estimate the liquidation cost of the redemption portfolio. The portfolios have been chosen in order to cover the main asset classes: large-cap stocks, small-cap stocks, sovereign bonds and corporate bonds. Since we provide the data in the appendix, these basic examples are easily reproducible and may help quantitative analysts to understand the different steps to implement liquidity stress testing in asset management.},

  abstract         = {This article studies the impact of carbon risk on stock pricing. To address this, we consider the seminal approach of Gorgen et al. (2019), who proposed estimating the carbon financial risk of equities by their carbon beta. To achieve this, the primary task is to develop a brown-minus-green (or BMG) risk factor, similar to Fama and French (1992). Secondly, we must estimate the carbon beta using a multi-factor model. While Gorgen et al. (2019) considered that the carbon beta is constant, we propose a time-varying estimation model to assess the dynamics of the carbon risk. Moreover, we test several specifications of the BMG factor to understand which climate change-related dimensions are priced in by the stock market. In the second part of the article, we focus on the carbon risk management of investment portfolios. First, we analyze how carbon risk impacts the construction of a minimum variance portfolio. As the goal of this portfolio is to reduce unrewarded financial risks of an investment, incorporating the carbon risk into this approach fulfills this objective. Second, we propose a new framework for building enhanced index portfolios with a lower exposure to carbon risk than capitalization-weighted stock indices. Finally, we explore how carbon sensitivities can improve the robustness of factor investing portfolios.},

These ALM tools can be split into three categories: measurement tools, management tools and monitoring tools. In terms of measurement tools, we focus on the computation of the redemption coverage ratio (RCR), which is the central instrument of liquidity stress testing programs. We also study the redemption liquidation policy and the different implementation methodologies, and we show how reverse stress testing can be developed. In terms of liquidity management tools, we study the calibration of liquidity buffers, the pros and cons of special arrangements (redemption suspensions, gates, side pockets and in-kind redemptions) and the effectiveness of swing pricing. In terms of liquidity monitoring tools, we compare the macro- and micro-approaches of liquidity monitoring in order to identify the transmission channels of liquidity risk.},

Moreover, we must also distinguish aggregate population models and individual-based models if we want to develop behavioral approaches. Once these different statistical models are calibrated, the second big issue is the risk measure to assess normal and stressed redemption shocks. Finally, the last issue is to develop a factor model that can translate stress scenarios on market risk factors into stress scenarios on fund liabilities.},

The chapter discusses three main models of smart beta portfolios: the equal risk contribution portfolio, the risk budgeting portfolio, and the most diversified portfolio. A robo-advisor has two main objectives. The first objective is to know the investor better than a traditional asset manager. Because of this better knowledge, the robo-advisor may propose a more appropriate asset allocation. The second objective is to perform the task in a systematic way and to build an automated rebalancing process.},

  abstract         = {Although portfolio management didn't change much during the 40 years after the seminal works of Markowitz and Sharpe, the development of risk budgeting techniques marked an important milestone in the deepening of the relationship between risk and asset management. Risk parity then became a popular financial model of investment after the global financial crisis in 2008. Today, pension funds and institutional investors are using this approach in the development of smart indexing and the redefinition of long-term investment policies.

Written by a well-known expert of asset management and risk parity, Introduction to Risk Parity and Budgeting provides an up-to-date treatment of this alternative method to Markowitz optimization. It builds financial exposure to equities and commodities, considers credit risk in the management of bond portfolios, and designs long-term investment policy.

The first part of the book gives a theoretical account of portfolio optimization and risk parity. The author discusses modern portfolio theory and offers a comprehensive guide to risk budgeting. Each chapter in the second part presents an application of risk parity to a specific asset class. The text covers risk-based equity indexation (also called smart beta) and shows how to use risk budgeting techniques to manage bond portfolios. It also explores alternative investments, such as commodities and hedge funds, and applies risk parity techniques to multi-asset classes.

The book's first appendix provides technical materials on optimization problems, copula functions, and dynamic asset allocation. The second appendix contains 30 tutorial exercises. Solutions to the exercises, slides for instructors, and Gauss computer programs to reproduce the book's examples, tables, and figures are available on the author's website.},

  abstract             = {The concept of alternative risk premia is an extension of the factor investing approach. Factor investing consists in building long-only equity portfolios, which are directly exposed to common risk factors like size, value or momentum. Alternative risk premia designate non-traditional risk premia other than a long exposure to equities and bonds. They may involve equities, rates, credit, currencies or commodities and correspond to long/short portfolios. However, contrary to traditional risk premia, it is more difficult to define alternative risk premia and which risk premia really matter. In fact, the term "alternative risk premia encompasses"two different types of systematic risk factor: skewness risk premia and market anomalies. For example, the most frequent alternative risk premia are carry and momentum, which are respectively a skewness risk premium and a market anomaly. Because the returns of alternative risk premia exhibit heterogeneous patterns in terms of statistical properties, option profile and drawdown, asset allocation is more complex than with traditional risk premia. In this context, risk diversification cannot be reduced to volatility diversification and skewness risk becomes a key component of portfolio optimization. Understanding these different concepts and how they interconnect is essential for improving multi-asset allocation.},

  abstract             = {The concept of alternative risk premia (ARP) is an extension of the factor investing approach. Factor investing consists of building long-only equity portfolios which are directly exposed to common risk factors such as size, value or momentum. ARP designate non-traditional risk premia other than a long exposure to equities and bonds. They may involve equities, rates, credit, currencies or commodities and correspond to long-short portfolios. However, contrary to traditional risk premia, it is more difficult to define ARP in terms of which risk premia really matter. In fact, the term "alternative risk premia" encompasses two different types of systematic risk factor: skewness risk premia and market anomalies. For example, the most frequent ARP are carry and momentum, which are, respectively, a skewness risk premium and a market anomaly. Because the returns of ARP exhibit heterogeneous patterns in terms of statistical properties, option profiles and drawdown, asset allocation is more complex than with traditional risk premia. In this context, risk diversification cannot be reduced to volatility diversification and skewness risk becomes a key component of portfolio optimization. Understanding these different concepts and how they interconnect is essential for improving multi-asset allocation.},

  abstract             = {The momentum risk premium is one of the most important alternative risk premia alongside the carry risk premium. However, it appears that it is not always well understood. For example, is it an alpha or a beta exposure? Is it a skewness risk premium or a market anomaly? Does it pursue a performance objective or a hedging objective? What are the differences between time-series and cross-section momentum? What are the main drivers of momentum returns? What does it mean when we say that it is a convex and not a concave strategy? Why is the momentum risk premium a diversifying engine, and not an absolute return strategy?

The goal of this paper is to provide specific and relevant answers to all these questions. The answers can already be found in the technical paper "Understanding the Momentum Risk Premium" published recently by Jusselin et al. (2017). However, the underlying mathematics can be daunting to readers. Therefore, this discussion paper presents the key messages and the associated financial insights behind these results.

Among the main findings, one result is of the most importance. To trend is to diversify in bad times. In good times, trend-following strategies offer no significant diversification power. Indeed, they are beta strategies. This is not a problem, since investors do not need to be diversified at all times. In particular, they do not need diversification in good times, because they do not want that the positive returns generated by some assets to be cancelled out by negative returns on other assets. This is why diversification may destroy portfolio performance in good times. Investors only need diversification in bad economic times and stressed markets.

This diversification asymmetry is essential when investing in beta strategies like alternative risk premia. On the contrary, this diversification asymmetry is irrelevant when investing in absolute return strategies. However, we know that generating performance with alpha strategies is much more difficult than generating performance with beta strategies. Therefore, beta is beautiful, but convex beta is precious and scarce. Among risk premia, momentum is one of the few strategies to offer this diversification asymmetry. This is why investing in momentum is a decision of portfolio construction, and not a search for alpha.},

Indeed, we develop an algorithm that mixes the method of cyclical coordinate descent (CCD), alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), proximal operators and Dykstra's algorithm. This theoretical body is then applied to some investment problems. In particular, we show how to dynamically control the turnover of a risk parity portfolio and how to build smart beta portfolios based on the ERC approach by improving the liquidity of the portfolio or reducing the small cap bias.

  abstract         = {Portfolio optimization emerged with the seminal paper of Markowitz (1952). The original mean-variance framework is appealing because it is very efficient from a computational point of view. However, it also has one well-established failing since it can lead to portfolios that are not optimal from a financial point of view (Michaud, 1989). Nevertheless, very few models have succeeded in providing a real alternative solution to the Markowitz model. The main reason lies in the fact that most academic portfolio optimization models are intractable in real life although they present solid theoretical properties. By intractable we mean that they can be implemented for an investment universe with a small number of assets using a lot of computational resources and skills, but they are unable to manage a universe with dozens or hundreds of assets. However, the emergence and the rapid development of robo-advisors means that we need to rethink portfolio optimization and go beyond the traditional mean-variance optimization approach.Another industry and branch of science has faced similar issues concerning large-scale optimization problems. Machine learning and applied statistics have long been associated with linear and logistic regression models. Again, the reason was the inability of optimization algorithms to solve high-dimensional industrial problems. Nevertheless, the end of the 1990s marked an important turning point with the development and the rediscovery of several methods that have since produced impressive results. The goal of this paper is to show how portfolio allocation can benefit from the development of these large-scale optimization algorithms. Not all of these algorithms are useful in our case, but four of them are essential when solving complex portfolio optimization problems. These four algorithms are the coordinate descent, the alternating direction method of multipliers, the proximal gradient method and the Dykstra's algorithm. This paper reviews them and shows how they can be implemented in portfolio allocation.},

The prominent equal weight or one-over-N portfolio, which puts equal weight on each asset, is apart from its simplicity a strategy which is hard to outperform in realistic settings. But depending on the number of considered assets it can lead to very large portfolios. An approach to reduce the number of chosen assets based on clustering is proposed and its advantages and disadvantages are investigated. Using clustering techniques the possible assets are separated into non-overlapping clusters and the assets within a cluster are ordered by their Sharpe ratio. Then the best asset of each portfolio is chosen to be a member of the new portfolio with equal weights, the cluster portfolio. It is shown that this portfolio inherits the advantages of the equal weight portfolio and that it can even outperform it empirically. To this end different performance measures are used to compare the portfolios on simulated and real data. To explain the observations on real data, explanatory results are derived in an extreme model setting and analyzed in several simulation studies.},

Robust optimisation is the latest attempt to address estimation error directly in the portfolio construction process. It will be shown that robust optimisation is equivalent to Bayesian shrinkage estimators and offer no marginal value relative to the former.

The implied shrinkage that comes with robust optimisation is difficult to control. Consistent with the ad hoc treatment of uncertainty aversion in robust optimisation, it can be seen that out of sample performance largely depends on the appropriate choice of uncertainty aversion, with no guideline on how to calibrate this parameter or how to make it consistent with the more well-known risk aversion.},

We need to better understand the investment problem for an SWF in order to project future investment flows. Extending Gintschel and Scherer (J. Asset Manag. 9(3):215-238, 2008), we apply the portfolio choice problem for a sovereign wealth fund in a Campbell and Viceira (Strategic Asset Allocation, 2002) strategic asset allocation framework. Changing the analysis from a one to a multi-period framework allows us to establish a three-fund separation. We split the optimal portfolio for an SWF into speculative demand as well as hedge demand against oil price shocks and shocks to the short-term risk-free rate. In addition, all terms now depend on the investor's time horizon. We show that oil-rich countries should hold bonds and that the optimal investment policy for an SWF as a long-term investor is determined by long-run covariance matrices that differ from the correlation inputs that one-period (myopic) investors use.},

Not only does this challenge the academic risk management literature about the predominance of operative risks in asset management, it is also at odds with current practice in asset management firms.

Asset managers do not hedge market risks even though these risks are systematically built into the revenue generation process. This is surprising as shareholders would not optimally choose asset management companies as their source of market beta. They rather prefer to participate in alpha generation and fund gathering expertise of investment managers as financial intermediaries.

At the very minimum, asset managers need to monitor their fees at risk to understand what impact product design, benchmark choice and fee contract design have on revenue volatility. This calls for a much wider interpretation of the risk management function that too narrowly focuses on client risks.},

For US futures data I show that risk parity is not about diversification, but about higher return expectations for leveraged low-risk bonds. Although this is consistent with leverage aversion, it is incompatible with consumption-based asset pricing. In contrast to past work, I use futures data instead of diversified equity and bond indices. This allows concerns raised earlier about the availability of historic implementation costs or the historic price of leverage to be sidestepped.},

There is a cross-sectional and a time series aspect of this procedure. In the cross-sectional dimension, we scale all assets to a common target volatility. After scaling, all assets will display similar realized volatility, i.e. all assets will be equally important for overall portfolio risk and performance.

The objective here is better asset diversification. If all assets display equal Sharpe ratio and equal correlation, the resulting portfolio is also mean variance efficient. In the time series dimension, we want to achieve better time diversification, i.e. we want to make every period equally important for overall portfolio risk and performance. Both aspects of diversification can be found to different degrees in risk parity (predominantly cross sectional volatility scaling) as well as target volatility (predominantly time series volatility scaling) products.

This contribution will focus on the theoretical and empirical foundations of target volatility. If target volatility offers better time diversification (even without larger expected returns), target volatility products will outperform buy and hold products by offering lower risk per unit of return. This will then lead to higher Sharpe ratios and mean variance utility.},

The key is to understand that Bayesian methods are literally impossible to test out-of-sample. For every distribution, a prior will be found that will outperform resampling (and vice versa). Equally, for every prior, a distribution will be found where resampling outperforms. The fact that one method outperforms another for a given set of data means little.

  abstract             = {Automated asset management offerings algorithmically assign risky portfolios to individual investors based on investor characteristics such as age, net income, or self-assessment of risk aversion. Using new German household panel data, we investigate the key household characteristics that drive private asset allocation decisions. This information allows us to assess which set of variables should be included in algorithmic portfolio advice. Using heavily cross-validated classification trees, we find that a combination of household balance sheet variables-describing the ability to take risks (e.g., net wealth)-and household personal characteristics-describing the willingness to take risks (e.g., risk aversion)-best explain the cross-sectional variation in household portfolio choice. Our empirical evidence is in line with models of portfolio choice under decreasing relative risk aversion and fixed investment costs. The results suggest the utility of a more holistic modeling of household characteristics. Including background risks in the form of household leverage not only makes investment sense, but is also the new regulatory reality under MIFID II rules. Robo-advisors are strongly advised to act accordingly.},

A closer look at the costs of constraints suggests a new methodology to measure the impact of individual constraints on an investor's value added.

If the trading day starts in Japan, by the time the U.S. stock market opens, the European markets have been trading for hours and the Japanese stock market is already closed. A major event with worldwide implications that occurs during New York trading hours will not show up in the Nikkei until the next day, while it will be reflected in returns on the German DAX either the same day or the next, depending on the time. Procedures that synchronize returns to correct correlation estimates for this effect show that true correlations are much higher than uncorrected estimates computed from returns. Without such corrections, risk measures like Value-at-Risk will be significantly underestimated.},

Ignoring shadow assets is unfortunate, as it is the existence and nature of shadow assets that distinguishes private investors, university endowments, sovereign wealth funds, and family offices and hence leads to different demands for risky securities. Shadow assets influence the outcome of asset allocation decisions via their covariance with financial assets and their effect on total wealth. Adding shadow assets has two effects on investors: It makes investors more aggressive and can create demand for hedges. Investment advice in the client's best interests needs to incorporate shadow assets as well as shadow liabilities, as optimal allocations differ considerably when shadow components are properly accounted for},

The first step of HRP (quasi-diagonalization), determining the hierarchy of assets, is required for the actual allocation done in the second step (recursive bisectioning). In the original HRP scheme, this hierarchy is found using single-linkage hierarchical clustering of the correlation matrix, which is a static tree-based method. The authors compare the performance of the standard HRP with other static and adaptive tree-based methods, as well as seriation-based methods that do not rely on trees. Seriation is a broader concept allowing reordering of the rows or columns of a matrix to best express similarities between the elements. Each discussed variation leads to a different time series reflecting portfolio performance using a 20-year backtest of a multi-asset futures universe. Unsupervised learningbased on these time-series creates a taxonomy that groups the strategies in high correspondence to the construction hierarchy of the various types of ASRP. Performance analysis of the variations shows that most of the static tree-based alternatives to HRP outperform the single-linkage clustering used in HRP on a risk-adjusted basis. Adaptive tree methods show mixed results, and most generic seriation-based approaches underperform.},

  abstract         = {Financial machine learning (FinML) has in recent years developed into a subdiscipline in its own right with enthusiastic experimenters at its helm. Since investigating the subject five years ago, there has been an almost exponential progress in academic interest. When I first started thinking about machine learning in finance, formal research was sparse, to say the least. As a result, I have had the luxury to pick from a broad range of topics and decided to investigate financial event prediction using machine learning, giving rise to the eponymous title.FinML research can loosely be divided into four streams. The first concerns asset price prediction where researchers attempt to predict the future value of securities using a machine learning methodology. The second stream involves predicting hard or soft financial events like earnings surprises, corporate defaults, and mergers and acquisitions. The third stream entails the prediction and or estimation of values not directly related to the price of a security, such as future revenue, firm valuation, credit ratings, etc. The fourth and last stream comprises the use of machine learning techniques to solve traditional optimisation problems in finance like optimal execution and the optimal construction of portfolios. This thesis, in particular, focuses on the use of machine learning in financial event prediction. In the past, finance academics had to be content with mostly linear models that could only ingest a small number of variables of a particular type. Now we can use non-linear models with a larger number of variables and more versatile data types. In this thesis, I show how machine learning can lead to significant improvements in financial event prediction, more specifically, in earnings surprise, bankruptcy and facility closure predictions, all of which have significant financial implications for the businesses and stakeholders alike.},

Historically, algorithmic trading could be more narrowly defined as the automation of sell-side trade execution, but since the introduction of more advanced algorithms, the definition has grown to include idea generation, alpha factor design, asset allocation, position sizing, and the testing of strategies. Machine learning, from the vantage of a decision-making tool, can help in all these areas.},

There has been an active debate across the globe about the need, scope, scale, and depth of policies to facilitate a smooth journey to net zero by 2050. In this article, the authors examine the different channels by which climate risks can impact the economy and discuss the role of central banks in fighting climate change. Climate risks induce supply and demand shocks, which can have a material impact on inflation and growth. The authors concur with the concern of the European Central Bank that the transition could be inflationary in the near term. Although important, they believe that the role of central banks is likely to be somewhat limited in the battle against climate change; the pathways to effect change through central bank policy are indirect and dependent on transmission through other channels that weaken efficacy. Nevertheless, the authors conclude that incorporating appropriate climate risk tests into the regulatory framework fall within the central banks' mandate of ensuring financial stability.},

They find that the US dollar is the dominant currency in global economic activities ranging from trade to cross-border banking, and this USD strength is reflected in the ability of US Treasuries to diversify local economic shocks. While they find that US Treasuries provide historically better diversification for local equity risk than local sovereign debt, in an ultra-low interest rate world, investors will likely need to consider alternative hedging approaches. As an illustration of a potential alternative, the authors turn to the currency markets and show that a short euro versus long Japanese yen position has had stable to improving performance as a hedging tool. The key message is that alternative hedging strategies merit a robust discussion and consideration in a low-yield environment.},

In this article, we show that although trade globalization has stalled since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), financial globalization has continued to increase. We further show that financial globalization has a much more significant impact on portfolios than trade globalization. The primary mechanism of this impact, US dollar hegemony, impacts portfolios primarily through increased spillover of US monetary policy shocks. The two implications for investors are: (1) global equity markets have become increasingly correlated and are likely to stay that way, and (2) this increased correlation reduces the benefits of portfolio diversification and leads to a more concentrated exposure to US monetary policy shocks.},

This article examines that important question. Using well-accepted metrics of idiosyncratic volatility, the authors find that the effectiveness of both the momentum and the valuation signals critically depends on cross-sectional differences in idiosyncratic volatility. In particular, they find that the mean reversion signal works better for firms with low idiosyncratic volatility, whereas the momentum signal works better for those with high idiosyncratic volatility. This result is robust across different regimes of idiosyncratic volatility.

Finally, the authors test whether a measure of idiosyncratic volatility has an impact on the Fed Model for asset allocation. They find that conditioning the signal in the Fed Model for cross-sectional differences in idiosyncratic volatility significantly improves the mean reversion effect that underlies the Fed Model

. In summary, they note that it is important to condition stock selection and asset allocation models for cross-sectional differences in idiosyncratic volatility.},

Portfolio managers, consultants, and strategists in charge of SAA use a wider variety of asset classes than just stocks, bonds, and cash (to manage style tilts and control currency exposures) and are dynamic in their choices.

This article expands the traditional SAA framework to accommodate seven different and popular sources of additional exposures. By expanding the concept of asset allocation from traditional assets to accommodate additional factors tilts using a Brinson-type analysis, the authors show that expanded SAA explains nearly 90 percent of the variation in active returns, absorbing some of the value added by active management. Analysis of moderate versus conservatively managed funds shows that the ability to add value from active management is partially dependent on the risk budget provided to the active manager.

Importantly, this article shows that the majority of excess return in active management comes from the risk premium due to exposure to additional risk factors that can frequently be absorbed within the expanded SAA framework. This implies that it is important to view strategic asset allocation under the expanded framework as it is more reflective of practice and allows better assessment of the role of active management.},

While identifying all sources that account for the stochasticity of models is challenging, it is common to augment predictions with confidence intervals to convey the expected variations in a model's behavior. We require prediction intervals to be well-calibrated, reflect the true uncertainties, and to be sharp. However, existing techniques for obtaining prediction intervals are known to produce unsatisfactory results in at least one of these criteria. To address this challenge, we develop a novel approach for building calibrated estimators. More specifically, we use separate models for prediction and interval estimation, and pose a bi-level optimization problem that allows the former to leverage estimates from the latter through an uncertainty matching strategy. Using experiments in regression, time-series forecasting, and object localization, we show that our approach achieves significant improvements over existing uncertainty quantification methods, both in terms of model fidelity and calibration error.},

Specifically, we propose a new method to compute an interpretable clustering automatically, where the explanation is in the original high-dimensional space and the clustering is coherent in the low-dimensional projection. It provides a tunable balance between the complexity and the amount of information provided, through the use of information theory. We study the computational complexity of this problem and introduce restrictions on the search space of solutions to arrive at an efficient, tunable, greedy optimization algorithm. This algorithm is furthermore implemented in an interactive tool called ExClus. Experiments on several data sets highlight that ExClus can provide informative and easy-to-understand patterns, and they expose where the algorithm is efficient and where there is room for improvement considering tunability and scalability.},

We construct four networks (complete graph, a minimum spanning tree, a planar maximally filtered graph, and a threshold significance graph) and use three centrality measures (betweenness, eigenvalue centrality, and the expected force). To improve risk return characteristics of well-known return maximization and risk minimization benchmark portfolios, we propose simple adjustments to portfolio selection strategies that utilize centralization measures from financial networks. From a sample of 45 assets (stock market indices, bond and money market instruments, commodities, and foreign exchange rates) and from data for 1999 to 2015, we show that irrespective of the network and centrality employed, the proposed network-based asset allocation strategies improve key portfolio return characteristics in an out of sample framework, most notably, risk and left tail risk adjusted returns. Resolving portfolio model selection uncertainties further improves risk return characteristics. Improvements made to portfolio strategies based on risk minimization are also robust to transaction costs.},

Here we use the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method to analyze the cross-correlation structure among different level of fluctuations for financial assets. The correlation-based networks are then employed to determine the clustering property of stock market. We then propose several portfolio optimization strategies based on the EMD correlation-based networks.

The main methods used are bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review. Evaluating the number of assets which lead to optimal diversification is not an easy task as it is impacted by a huge number of different factors: the way systematic risk is measured, the investment universe (size, asset classes and features of the asset classes), the investor's characteristics, the change over time of the asset features, the model adopted to measure diversification (i.e., equally weighted versus optimal allocation), the frequency of the data that is being used, together with the time horizon, conditions in the market that the study refers to, etc. Our paper provides additional support for the fact that (1) a generalized optimal number of stocks that constitute a well-diversified portfolio does not exist for whichever market, period or investor. Recent studies further suggest that (2) the size of a well-diversified portfolio is larger today than in the past, (3) this number is lower in emerging markets compared to developed financial markets, (4) the higher the stock correlations with the market, the lower the number of stocks required for a well-diversified portfolio for individual investors, and (5) machine learning methods could potentially improve the investment decision process. Our results could be helpful to private and institutional investors in constructing and managing their portfolios and provide a framework for future research.},

Our model includes transaction costs and double cardinality constraints in order to capture the trade-off between the limit of investment scale and the diversified industry coverage requirement. We first derive a closed-form solution for the robust CVaR portfolio rebalancing model with only transaction costs. This allows us to conduct an industry risk analysis for sparse portfolio rebalancing in the absence of diversification constraints. Then, we attempt to remedy the hidden industry risk by establishing a new robust portfolio rebalancing model with both sparse and diversified constraints. This is followed by the development of a distributed-version of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, where each subproblem admits a closed-form solution. Finally, we conduct empirical tests to compare our proposed strategy with the standard sparse rebalancing and no-rebalancing strategies. The computational results demonstrate that our rebalancing approach produces sparse and diversified portfolios with better industry coverage. Additionally, to measure out-of-sample performance, two superiority indices are created based on worst-case CVaR and annualized return, respectively. Our ADMM strategy outperforms the sparse rebalancing and no-rebalancing strategies in terms of these indices.},

We reconcile this apparent contradiction. We explain why constraining portfolio weights to be nonnegative can reduce the risk in estimated optimal portfolios even when the constraints are wrong.

  abstract         = {In this paper, we construct a pipeline to investigate heuristic diversification strategies in asset allocation. We use machine learning concepts ("explainable AI") to compare the robustness of different strategies and back out implicit rules for decision making.In a first step, we augment the asset universe (the empirical dataset) with a range of scenarios generated with a block bootstrap from the empirical dataset.Second, we backtest the candidate strategies over a long period of time, checking their performance variability. Third, we use XGBoost as a regression model to connect the difference between the measured performances between two strategies to a pool of statistical features of the portfolio universe tailored to the investigated strategy. Finally, we employ the concept of Shapley values to extract the relationships that the model could identify between the portfolio characteristics and the statistical properties of the asset universe. We test this pipeline for studying risk-parity strategies with a volatility target, and in particular, comparing the machine learning-driven Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) to the classical Equal Risk Contribution (ERC) strategy.In the augmented dataset built from a multi-asset investment universe of commodities, equities and fixed income futures, we find that HRP better matches the volatility target, and shows better risk-adjusted performances. Finally, we train XGBoost to learn the difference between the realized Calmar ratios of HRP and ERC and extract explanations.The explanations provide fruitful ex-post indications of the connection between the statistical properties of the universe and the strategy performance in the training set. For example, the model confirms that features addressing the hierarchical properties of the universe are connected to the relative performance of HRP respect to ERC.},
